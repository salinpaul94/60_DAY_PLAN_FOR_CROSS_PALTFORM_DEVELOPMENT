### Day 13 Study Plan: Advanced Topics in Full-Stack Development

#### Task 1: Understanding and Implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js
**Explanation:**
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web page is rendered on the server instead of in the browser. This can improve performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered HTML pages to the client. Next.js is a React framework that enables SSR, providing a seamless experience for building server-rendered React applications.

Using Next.js for SSR involves setting up a Next.js project, defining server-rendered pages, and implementing data fetching methods. This approach ensures that your application is performant and SEO-friendly, providing a better user experience.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
2. [Server-Side Rendering in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)

**Example 1: Setting Up a Next.js Project**
1. **Creating a Next.js Project:** Use Create Next App to set up a new Next.js project.
2. **Defining Server-Rendered Pages:** Implement server-rendered pages in the Next.js project.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Creating a Next.js project involves using the Create Next App CLI tool to generate a new project with the necessary dependencies and configurations. Defining server-rendered pages involves creating React components that will be rendered on the server, ensuring that the HTML is fully rendered before being sent to the client.

**Example 2: Implementing Data Fetching Methods**
1. **Using getServerSideProps:** Implement the `getServerSideProps` method to fetch data on the server and pass it to the component.
2. **Rendering Data on the Server:** Use the fetched data to render the component on the server, providing a fully rendered HTML page to the client.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Using `getServerSideProps` involves defining a function to fetch data on the server before rendering the component. Rendering the component with the fetched data ensures that the HTML is fully rendered on the server, improving performance and SEO.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Next.js getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)

#### Task 8: Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing
**Explanation:**
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern that separates read and write operations into different models. This separation allows for more efficient querying and better scalability. Event Sourcing is a pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events, rather than as a direct update to the data store. This provides a complete history of changes, enabling better auditing and rollback capabilities.

Using CQRS and Event Sourcing involves defining separate models for reading and writing data and implementing event storage to capture all state changes. This approach ensures that your application can handle complex scenarios efficiently, providing better performance and scalability.

**Online Resources:**
1. [CQRS Documentation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)
2. [Event Sourcing Basics](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)

**Example 1: Implementing CQRS**
1. **Defining Read and Write Models:** Separate the read and write models in your application to handle different types of operations.
2. **Implementing Command Handlers:** Implement command handlers to process write operations and update the data store.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Defining read and write models involves creating separate models to handle reading and writing data, ensuring that each model is optimized for its specific purpose. Implementing command handlers involves writing functions to process commands (write operations) and update the data store, providing a clear separation of responsibilities.

**Example 2: Implementing Event Sourcing**
1. **Storing Events:** Implement logic to store events representing state changes in an event store.
2. **Replaying Events:** Implement logic to replay events to reconstruct the current state of the application.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Storing events involves capturing state changes as events and storing them in an event store, ensuring that all changes are recorded. Replaying events involves reading the stored events and applying them to reconstruct the current state, enabling accurate and up-to-date state management.

**Online Resources:**
1. [CQRS and Event Sourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)

# Implementing CQRS
# Define read and write models:
const readModel = {
  getProducts: () => {
    // Logic to fetch products from the database
  }
};

const writeModel = {
  addProduct: (product) => {
    // Logic to add a product to the database
  }
};

# Implementing command handlers:
const commandHandlers = {
  handleAddProduct: (product) => {
    // Validate and process the command
    writeModel.addProduct(product);
  }
};

# Expected Output: Read and write models are separated, with command handlers processing write operations.
```

```js
# Implementing Event Sourcing
# Install a library for event storage:
npm install eventstore

# Storing events:
const eventStore = require('eventstore')();

const storeEvent = (event) => {
  eventStore.emit(event.type, event);
};

storeEvent({ type: 'productAdded', data: { id: 1, name: 'Table' } });

# Replaying events:
const replayEvents = () => {
  eventStore.on('productAdded', (event) => {
    // Apply the event to reconstruct state
    console.log('Replaying event:', event);
  });

  eventStore.events.forEach((event) => {
    eventStore.emit(event.type, event);
  });
};

replayEvents();

# Expected Output: Events are stored and replayed to reconstruct the current state, enabling event sourcing.
