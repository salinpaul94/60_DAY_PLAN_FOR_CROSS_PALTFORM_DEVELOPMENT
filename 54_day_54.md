### Task 1: Study Offline-First Design Principles

#### Overview of Offline-First Design Principles
Offline-first design principles focus on creating applications that provide a seamless user experience regardless of the user's network connectivity. The core idea is to ensure that the application remains functional even when the user is offline, by storing data locally and synchronizing it with the server when the network is available. This approach enhances user satisfaction, especially in areas with unreliable or intermittent network connections, and ensures data consistency and reliability.

Implementing offline-first design involves several strategies, such as local data storage using databases like SQLite or Realm, caching strategies for assets and API responses, and background synchronization techniques. Developers must also handle potential conflicts during data synchronization, providing a robust user experience even in offline scenarios. By adopting these principles, developers can create resilient and user-friendly applications.

### Example 1: Caching API Responses for Offline Access
#### Explanation
Caching API responses is a fundamental offline-first technique. It involves storing the responses of API calls locally so that the application can access the data even when the network is unavailable. This ensures that users can still view previously loaded data and perform read operations offline.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that fetches data from an API and caches the response using AsyncStorage. The application will display the cached data when the network is unavailable, demonstrating how to implement basic caching for offline access.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [isOffline, setIsOffline] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const netInfo = await NetInfo.fetch();
      if (!netInfo.isConnected) {
        setIsOffline(true);
        const cachedData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('apiData');
        if (cachedData) {
          setData(JSON.parse(cachedData));
        } else {
          Alert.alert('No internet connection and no cached data found.');
        }
      } else {
        try {
          const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
          const result = await response.json();
          setData(result);
          await AsyncStorage.setItem('apiData', JSON.stringify(result));
        } catch (error) {
          Alert.alert('Failed to fetch data from API.');
        }
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Offline-First Design: Caching API Responses</Text>
      {isOffline && <Text style={styles.offlineText}>You are offline. Displaying cached data.</Text>}
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  offlineText: {
    color: 'red',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the API and cache it locally using AsyncStorage. If the network is unavailable, the app will display the cached data. This demonstrates how to implement basic caching of API responses for offline access in a React Native application.

### Example 2: Local Data Storage with SQLite
#### Explanation
Using local databases like SQLite is another effective offline-first strategy. SQLite allows applications to store structured data locally, providing powerful query capabilities and persistent storage. This is particularly useful for applications that need to store and manage large amounts of data offline.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses SQLite to store and retrieve data locally. The application will allow users to add, view, and delete records, demonstrating how to use SQLite for local data storage in an offline-first application.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import SQLite from 'react-native-sqlite-storage';

const db = SQLite.openDatabase({ name: 'test.db', location: 'default' });

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT);',
        [],
        () => { console.log('Table created successfully'); },
        error => { console.log('Error creating table:', error); }
      );
      fetchData();
    });
  }, []);

  const fetchData = () => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM Items', [], (tx, results) => {
        const rows = results.rows.raw();
        setData(rows);
      });
    });
  };

  const addItem = () => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO Items (title) VALUES (?)', [text], (tx, results) => {
        if (results.rowsAffected > 0) {
          fetchData();
          setText('');
        }
      });
    });
  };

  const deleteItem = (id) => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql('DELETE FROM Items WHERE id = ?', [id], (tx, results) => {
        if (results.rowsAffected > 0) {
          fetchData();
        }
      });
    });
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Offline-First Design: Local Data Storage with SQLite</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Enter text"
        value={text}
        onChangeText={setText}
      />
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.itemContainer}>
            <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>
            <Button title="Delete" onPress={() => deleteItem(item.id)} />
          </View>
        )}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  itemContainer: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  item: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will create a SQLite database and a table to store items. Users can add new items to the database, view the list of stored items, and delete items. This demonstrates how to use SQLite for local data storage in an offline-first React Native application.

### Example 3: Background Synchronization with BackgroundFetch
#### Explanation
Background synchronization ensures that data is kept up-to-date by synchronizing local changes with the server when the network becomes available. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency and providing a seamless user experience in offline-first applications. Background tasks can be used to perform synchronization without requiring user interaction.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses the `react-native-background-fetch` library to perform background synchronization. The application will periodically fetch data from an API and update the local storage, demonstrating how to implement background synchronization in an offline-first application.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Flat

List, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import BackgroundFetch from 'react-native-background-fetch';
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const netInfo = await NetInfo.fetch();
      if (netInfo.isConnected) {
        try {
          const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
          const result = await response.json();
          setData(result);
          await AsyncStorage.setItem('apiData', JSON.stringify(result));
        } catch (error) {
          Alert.alert('Failed to fetch data from API.');
        }
      } else {
        const cachedData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('apiData');
        if (cachedData) {
          setData(JSON.parse(cachedData));
        } else {
          Alert.alert('No internet connection and no cached data found.');
        }
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    const onBackgroundFetch = async () => {
      await fetchData();
      BackgroundFetch.finish(BackgroundFetch.FETCH_RESULT_NEW_DATA);
    };

    BackgroundFetch.configure(
      {
        minimumFetchInterval: 15, // Fetch every 15 minutes
      },
      onBackgroundFetch,
      (error) => {
        console.error('Background fetch failed to start:', error);
      }
    );

    return () => {
      BackgroundFetch.stop();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Offline-First Design: Background Synchronization</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the API and cache it locally using AsyncStorage. The app will also configure background synchronization to periodically fetch data and update the local storage. If the network is unavailable, the app will display the cached data. This demonstrates how to implement background synchronization for offline-first applications using `react-native-background-fetch`.

### Task 2: Implement Offline Capabilities with Local Storage

#### Overview of Offline Capabilities with Local Storage
Offline capabilities in mobile applications are crucial for providing a seamless user experience, especially in areas with unreliable or intermittent internet connectivity. Local storage solutions like AsyncStorage, SQLite, and Realm allow applications to store data on the device, enabling users to access and interact with the app even when offline. Implementing offline capabilities ensures that data is stored locally and synchronized with the server once the connection is re-established.

Local storage involves saving various types of data, such as user settings, application state, and data fetched from APIs. By leveraging local storage, developers can create robust and resilient applications that maintain functionality and data integrity regardless of network conditions. Effective use of local storage also improves application performance by reducing the need to fetch data from remote servers repeatedly.

#### Resources to Learn Offline Capabilities with Local Storage
1. [AsyncStorage in React Native](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)
2. [Using SQLite in React Native](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage)

### Example 1: Using AsyncStorage for Offline Data Storage
#### Explanation
AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent key-value storage system for React Native. It allows developers to store data that needs to be persisted across app launches. AsyncStorage is often used for storing user preferences, application state, and simple data structures.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that stores user input in AsyncStorage. The application will save the input data locally and retrieve it upon subsequent launches, demonstrating basic offline data storage capabilities using AsyncStorage.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const App = () => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [storedData, setStoredData] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadData = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userInput');
        if (data) {
          setStoredData(data);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to load data.');
      }
    };

    loadData();
  }, []);

  const saveData = async () => {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('userInput', input);
      setStoredData(input);
      setInput('');
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Data saved successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save data.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Offline Storage with AsyncStorage</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Enter some text"
        value={input}
        onChangeText={setInput}
      />
      <Button title="Save Data" onPress={saveData} />
      {storedData && <Text style={styles.storedData}>Stored Data: {storedData}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  storedData: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will attempt to retrieve any previously saved user input from AsyncStorage and display it. Users can enter new text in the input field and save it. The saved data will persist across app launches, demonstrating how to implement offline data storage using AsyncStorage in a React Native application.

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will create a Realm database and a schema to store items. Users can add new items to the database, view the list of stored items, and delete items. This demonstrates how to use Realm for offline data storage in a React Native application.

### Task 3: Study Advanced Security Practices

#### Overview of Advanced Security Practices
Advanced security practices are essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of mobile applications. These practices include encryption, secure storage, secure communication, and user authentication. Implementing these security measures helps protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate risks such as data breaches and cyber attacks.

Encryption involves converting data into a secure format that can only be accessed by authorized parties. Secure storage ensures that sensitive data is stored in a way that prevents unauthorized access. Secure communication protocols like HTTPS ensure data transmitted over the network is encrypted. Robust user authentication mechanisms verify the identity of users and control access to the application. By adopting advanced security practices, developers can build secure and resilient applications.

Encrypting data before storing it on the device is a fundamental security practice. This ensures that even if the device is compromised, the data remains protected. In this example, we will use the `react-native-encrypted-storage` library to securely store and retrieve sensitive data in a React Native application.

The application will allow users to save a secret message, which will be encrypted and stored locally. Users can retrieve and decrypt the message, demonstrating how to implement encryption for data storage.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import EncryptedStorage from 'react-native-encrypted-storage';

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [storedMessage, setStoredMessage] = useState('');

  const saveMessage = async () => {
    try {
      await EncryptedStorage.setItem('secret_message', message);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Message saved securely!');
      setMessage('');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save message.');
    }
  };

  const loadMessage = async () => {
    try {
      const retrievedMessage = await EncryptedStorage.getItem('secret_message');
      if (retrievedMessage) {
        setStoredMessage(retrievedMessage);
      } else {
        Alert.alert('No message found');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to load message.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Secure Data Storage with Encryption</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Enter secret message"
        value={message}
        onChangeText={setMessage}
      />
      <Button title="Save Message" onPress={saveMessage} />
      <Button title="Load Message" onPress={loadMessage} />
      {storedMessage && <Text style={styles.storedMessage}>Stored Message: {storedMessage}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  storedMessage: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can enter a secret message and save it securely using `react-native-encrypted-storage`. The message will be encrypted and stored locally. Users can retrieve and decrypt the stored message, demonstrating secure data storage with encryption.

### Example 2: Implementing Secure Communication with HTTPS
#### Explanation
Ensuring secure communication between the client and server is critical for protecting data transmitted over the network. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data sent between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. In this example, we will configure a React Native application to communicate with a server over HTTPS.

The application will fetch data from an API endpoint secured with HTTPS and display the data. This demonstrates how to ensure secure communication with HTTPS in a React Native application.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Secure Communication with HTTPS</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the HTTPS-secured API endpoint and display it. This demonstrates how to ensure secure communication with HTTPS in a React Native application.

### Example 3: Implementing Biometric Authentication
#### Explanation
Biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to authenticate using their fingerprint, face recognition, or other biometric methods. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive parts of the application. In this example, we will use the `react-native-keychain` library to implement biometric authentication in a React Native application.

The application will prompt users to authenticate using biometrics before accessing secure data. This demonstrates how to implement biometric authentication in a React Native application.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';

const App = () => {
  const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  const authenticate = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await Keychain.getGenericPassword({
        authenticationPrompt: {
          title: 'Authentication Required',
          subtitle: 'Please authenticate to proceed',
        },
      });
      if (result) {
        setAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Success', 'Authenticated successfully!');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Failed', 'Authentication failed.');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to authenticate.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Biometric Authentication</Text>
      <Button title="Authenticate" onPress={authenticate} />
      {authenticated && <Text style={styles.authenticatedText}>You are authenticated!</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  authenticatedText: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'green',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can press the "Authenticate" button to trigger biometric authentication. If authentication is successful, a message will be displayed indicating that the user is authenticated. This demonstrates how to implement biometric authentication in a React Native application.

### Task 4: Implement Biometric Authentication

#### Overview of Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication uses unique biological characteristics—such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans—to verify a user's identity. This method provides a high level of security because biometric data is unique to each individual and difficult to replicate. In mobile applications, biometric authentication enhances security by adding an additional layer of protection for sensitive data and critical functionalities.

Implementing biometric authentication in a React Native application involves using native device capabilities to prompt the user for their biometric data. Libraries such as `react-native-keychain` and `react-native-touch-id` can be utilized to integrate biometric authentication into your application, making it easier to implement and manage.

          title: 'Authentication Required',
          subtitle: 'Please authenticate to proceed',
        },
      });
      if (result) {
        setAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Success', 'Authenticated successfully!');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Failed', 'Authentication failed.');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to authenticate.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Biometric Authentication</Text>
      <Button title="Authenticate" onPress={authenticate} />
      {authenticated && <Text style={styles.authenticatedText}>You are authenticated!</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

### Example 2: Using `react-native-touch-id` for Biometric Authentication
#### Explanation
The `react-native-touch-id` library is another popular choice for implementing biometric authentication in React Native applications. It provides support for Touch ID and Face ID on iOS and fingerprint authentication on Android. This library allows developers to easily add biometric authentication to their applications with minimal setup.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses `react-native-touch-id` to prompt the user for biometric authentication. The application will check if the device supports biometric authentication and then proceed with the authentication process.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import TouchID from 'react-native-touch-id';

const App = () => {
  const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  const authenticate = async () => {
    const optionalConfigObject = {
      title: 'Authentication Required',
      imageColor: '#e00606',
      imageErrorColor: '#ff0000',
      sensorDescription: 'Touch sensor',
      sensorErrorDescription: 'Failed',
      cancelText: 'Cancel',
      fallbackLabel: 'Show Passcode',
      unifiedErrors: false,
      passcodeFallback: false,
    };

    TouchID.authenticate('Please authenticate to proceed', optionalConfigObject)
      .then(success => {
        setAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Authenticated Successfully');
      })
      .catch(error => {
        Alert.alert('Authentication Failed', error.message);
      });
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Biometric Authentication</Text>
      <Button title="Authenticate" onPress={authenticate} />
      {authenticated && <Text style={styles.authenticatedText}>You are authenticated!</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  authenticatedText: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'green',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

### Example 3: Combining Biometric Authentication with Secure Storage
#### Explanation
Combining biometric authentication with secure storage enhances the security of sensitive data in your application. This approach ensures that only authenticated users can access or retrieve sensitive information stored locally. In this example, we will use `react-native-keychain` to securely store and retrieve a sensitive piece of information, protected by biometric authentication.

The application will prompt the user for biometric authentication before allowing access to the secure data. This demonstrates how to combine biometric authentication with secure storage to protect sensitive information.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';

const App = () => {
  const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [secret, setSecret] = useState('');

  const saveSecret = async () => {
    try {
      await Keychain.setGenericPassword('username', 'my_secret_password', {
        accessControl: Keychain.ACCESS_CONTROL.BIOMETRY_ANY,
      });
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Secret saved securely!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save secret.');
    }
  };

  const authenticateAndRetrieveSecret = async () => {
    try {
      const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword({
        authenticationPrompt: {
          title: 'Authentication Required',
          subtitle: 'Please authenticate to retrieve your secret',
        },
      });
      if (credentials) {
        setAuthenticated(true);
        setSecret(credentials.password);
        Alert.alert('Success', 'Authenticated successfully!');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Failed', 'Authentication failed.');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to authenticate.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Biometric Authentication with Secure Storage</Text>
      <Button title="Save Secret" onPress={saveSecret} />
      <Button title="Authenticate and Retrieve Secret" onPress={authenticateAndRetrieveSecret} />
      {authenticated && <Text style={styles.secretText}>Your secret is: {secret}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  secretText: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'green',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can press the "Save Secret" button to securely save a secret using biometric authentication. To retrieve the secret, users must authenticate using their biometrics. If authentication is successful, the stored secret will be displayed. This demonstrates how to combine biometric authentication with secure storage in a React Native application using `react-native-keychain`.

### Task 5: Study API Security Best Practices

#### Overview of API Security Best Practices
API security is crucial for protecting the data and functionality of applications that interact with backend services. Ensuring that APIs are secure involves implementing measures such as authentication, authorization, encryption, rate limiting, and input validation. Properly securing APIs helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats that can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the data being transmitted.

Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the API, typically through mechanisms like API keys, OAuth, or JWT tokens. Authorization controls what authenticated users can do, ensuring they can only perform actions they are permitted to. Encryption protects data in transit using protocols like HTTPS, ensuring it cannot be intercepted and read by malicious actors. Implementing rate limiting helps prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time period. Input validation protects against injection attacks by ensuring that inputs to the API conform to expected formats and types.

2. [Best Practices for Securing Your APIs](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/04/16/api-security-best-practices)

### Example 1: Implementing JWT Authentication
#### Explanation
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties. JWTs are used for authentication and authorization, allowing the server to issue a token after verifying a user's credentials. This token can then be used for subsequent API requests to ensure the user is authenticated. JWTs are stateless, meaning they don't require the server to store session information, making them scalable and efficient.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses JWT for authentication. The application will send user credentials to an API endpoint, receive a JWT upon successful authentication, and use this token to access protected API routes.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [token, setToken] = useState('');
  const [data, setData] = useState('');

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
      });
      const result = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setToken(result.token);
        Alert.alert('Success', 'Logged in successfully!');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', result.message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to log in.');
    }
  };

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api/protected', {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        },
      });
      const result = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setData(result.data);
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', result.message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>JWT Authentication</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />
      {token && <Button title="Fetch Protected Data" onPress={fetchData} />}
      {data && <Text style={styles.data}>{data}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  data: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can enter their username and password to log in. Upon successful authentication, a JWT will be received and stored. Users can then use the token to fetch data from a protected API endpoint. This demonstrates how to implement JWT authentication in a React Native application.

### Example 2: Implementing HTTPS for Secure Communication
#### Explanation
Ensuring that API communication is secure involves using HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server. HTTPS protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring that data cannot be intercepted and read by malicious actors. Setting up HTTPS requires configuring the server with an SSL/TLS certificate and ensuring the client communicates with the server over HTTPS.

In this example, we will configure a React Native application to communicate with an API over HTTPS. The application will make API requests to an HTTPS-secured endpoint and handle the responses securely.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        const result = await response.json();
        if (response.ok) {
          setData(result);
        } else {
          Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Secure Communication with HTTPS</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the HTTPS-secured API endpoint and display it. This demonstrates how to ensure secure communication with HTTPS in a React Native application.

### Example 3: Implementing Rate Limiting
#### Explanation
Rate limiting helps prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time period. This protects the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests and ensures fair usage by all users. Implementing rate limiting involves setting up rules on the server to restrict the number of requests and responding with appropriate status codes when the limit is exceeded.

In this example, we will create a simple Node.js API that implements rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. The React Native application will make requests to this API and handle rate-limited responses.

#### Code (Node.js Server)
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const app = express();

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

app.use(limiter);

app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a rate-limited API endpoint.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Code (React Native)
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api');
      const result = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setData(result.message);
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', result.message);
      }
    } catch

 (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Rate Limiting Example</Text>
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
      {data && <Text style={styles.data}>{data}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },

    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  data: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can press the "Fetch Data" button to make a request to the rate-limited API. If the rate limit is exceeded, the server will respond with an appropriate message indicating that too many requests have been made. This demonstrates how to implement rate limiting in a Node.js API and handle rate-limited responses in a React Native application.

### Task 6: Implement API Rate Limiting

#### Overview of API Rate Limiting
API rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests that clients can make to an API within a specified time frame. This helps to prevent abuse, ensures fair usage among users, and protects the API from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. Rate limiting can be implemented using various algorithms such as fixed window, sliding window, token bucket, and leaky bucket. Each algorithm has its own approach to managing request limits and resetting them over time.

Rate limiting is typically enforced on the server side, where requests are tracked and limited based on criteria like IP address, API key, or user account. When a client exceeds the allowed number of requests, the server responds with a status code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and may include information about when the client can retry. This mechanism ensures that resources are used efficiently and that the API remains responsive and available to all users.

1. [Understanding Rate Limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/)
2. [API Rate Limiting Best Practices](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/)

### Example 1: Implementing Rate Limiting in a Node.js API
#### Explanation
In this example, we will create a simple Node.js API and implement rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This middleware allows us to define rate limiting rules, such as the maximum number of requests allowed within a certain time period. We will configure the API to limit each client to a specified number of requests per minute, returning a 429 status code if the limit is exceeded.

The Node.js API will have a single endpoint that clients can request. We will test the rate limiting by making multiple requests to this endpoint and observing the server's response when the limit is exceeded.

#### Code (Node.js Server)
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const app = express();

// Define rate limiting rules
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

// Apply the rate limiting middleware to all requests
app.use(limiter);

app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a rate-limited API endpoint.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Expected Output
When the server is running, clients can make up to 5 requests per minute to the `/api` endpoint. If a client exceeds this limit, the server responds with a 429 status code and a message indicating that too many requests have been made.

2. [Rate Limiting in Express](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/node-js-rate-limiting)

### Example 2: Handling Rate Limiting in a React Native Application
#### Explanation
In this example, we will create a React Native application that makes requests to the rate-limited Node.js API. The application will handle responses from the server, including the 429 status code, and display appropriate messages to the user. This demonstrates how to handle rate-limited responses in a client application.

The React Native application will include a button that triggers an API request when pressed. If the server responds with a rate-limited message, the application will inform the user and advise them to try again later.

#### Code (React Native)
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api');
      if (response.status === 429) {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Too many requests, please try again later.');
      } else {
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result.message);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch data.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Rate Limiting Example</Text>
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
      {data && <Text style={styles.data}>{data}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  data: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can press the "Fetch Data" button to make a request to the rate-limited API. If the rate limit is exceeded, the application will display an error message informing the user to try again later. Otherwise, the response data will be displayed.

### Example 3: Implementing Dynamic Rate Limiting Based on User Role
#### Explanation
In this example, we will extend the Node.js API to implement dynamic rate limiting based on user roles. Different user roles (e.g., regular users, premium users) will have different rate limits. We will modify the rate limiting middleware to check the user's role and apply the appropriate rate limit.

The Node.js API will include a middleware function to simulate user authentication and assign a role to each request. The rate limiting middleware will then apply different limits based on the assigned role.

#### Code (Node.js Server)
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const app = express();

// Middleware to simulate user authentication and role assignment
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.user = { role: 'regular' }; // Change this to 'premium' for testing
  next();
});

// Define rate limiting rules
const regularLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs for regular users
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

const premiumLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 10, // Limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs for premium users
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

// Apply dynamic rate limiting based on user role
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.role === 'premium') {
    premiumLimiter(req, res, next);
  } else {
    regularLimiter(req, res, next);
  }
});

app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a rate-limited API endpoint.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Expected Output
When the server is running, regular users can make up to 5 requests per minute to the `/api` endpoint, while premium users can make up to 10 requests per minute. If a user exceeds their limit, the server responds with a 429 status code and a rate-limited message.

### Task 7: Study Performance Profiling Tools

#### Overview of Performance Profiling Tools
Performance profiling tools are essential for analyzing and optimizing the performance of applications. These tools help developers identify bottlenecks, memory leaks, and inefficient code that can degrade the performance of an app. By using performance profiling tools, developers can ensure that their applications run smoothly and efficiently, providing a better user experience.

In React Native development, performance profiling tools can be used to monitor various aspects of the app, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and the frequency and duration of renders. Tools like React Native Performance Monitor, Flipper, and native profiling tools provided by Xcode and Android Studio are commonly used to profile React Native applications. These tools provide insights into how the application is performing and help developers make informed decisions to optimize their code.

#### Resources to Learn Performance Profiling
1. [React Native Performance Monitor](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance)
2. [Using Flipper with React Native](https://fbflipper.com/docs/features/react-native/)

### Example 1: Profiling Performance with React Native Performance Monitor
#### Explanation
React Native Performance Monitor is a built-in tool that provides insights into the performance of React Native applications. It displays key metrics such as FPS (frames per second), JS (JavaScript) thread usage, and memory usage. By using the Performance Monitor, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their applications accordingly.

In this example, we will create a React Native application and use the React Native Performance Monitor to analyze its performance. We will introduce some performance issues and use the Performance Monitor to identify and fix them.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const generateData = (count) => {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => ({ key: `${i}`, value: `Item ${i}` }));
};

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(generateData(1000));

  const addItem = () => {
    setData((prevData) => [...prevData, { key: `${prevData.length}`, value: `Item ${prevData.length}` }]);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>React Native Performance Monitor</Text>
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.value}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,

  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a list of 1000 items. Users can add more items to the list by pressing the "Add Item" button. By enabling the React Native Performance Monitor, developers can observe the impact of the large list and additional items on the app's performance and make optimizations as needed.

### Task 9: Study Memory Management Techniques

#### Overview of Memory Management Techniques
Memory management is a critical aspect of application development, ensuring efficient use of memory resources to avoid leaks, reduce memory consumption, and enhance overall app performance. Effective memory management involves monitoring memory usage, identifying and eliminating memory leaks, and optimizing data structures and algorithms to use memory efficiently.

In React Native, memory management is crucial due to the limited resources on mobile devices. Developers need to ensure that their applications do not consume excessive memory, which can lead to sluggish performance, application crashes, and a poor user experience. Techniques such as using appropriate data structures, avoiding unnecessary object allocations, and properly managing component lifecycles can help in managing memory effectively.

2. [Avoiding Memory Leaks in React Native](https://blog.bitsrc.io/avoiding-memory-leaks-in-react-native-1e5fce1b21d4)

### Example 1: Identifying and Fixing Memory Leaks
#### Explanation
Memory leaks occur when an application retains memory that is no longer needed, leading to increased memory usage over time. Common causes of memory leaks in React Native include event listeners that are not properly removed, timers that are not cleared, and unmounted components that still hold references to data.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that has a memory leak issue. We will use tools like Flipper to identify the memory leak and demonstrate how to fix it by properly managing event listeners and timers.

#### Code with Memory Leak
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Memory Leak Example</Text>
      <Text style={styles.counter}>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Reset" onPress={() => setCount(0)} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  counter: {
    fontSize: 18,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a counter that increments every second. If the component is unmounted, the interval should be cleared to prevent memory leaks. Developers can use Flipper to monitor memory usage and ensure that the interval is properly cleared.

### Example 2: Optimizing Data Structures and State Management
#### Explanation
Choosing the right data structures and state management techniques can significantly impact memory usage in a React Native application. Using large objects or arrays inefficiently can lead to high memory consumption. Optimizing state updates and using data structures that minimize memory overhead can help manage memory effectively.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses a large array for state management. We will demonstrate how to optimize memory usage by using more efficient data structures and reducing unnecessary state updates.

#### Code with Optimization
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const generateData = (count) => {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => ({ key: `${i}`, value: `Item ${i}` }));
};

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(generateData(1000));

  const addItem = () => {
    setData((prevData) => {
      const newData = [...prevData];
      newData.push({ key: `${prevData.length}`, value: `Item ${prevData.length}` });
      return newData;
    });
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Optimized Data Structures</Text>
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.value}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a list of 1000 items. Users can add more items to the list by pressing the "Add Item" button. The optimized code ensures efficient memory usage by minimizing unnecessary state updates and using appropriate data structures.

### Example 3: Managing Component Lifecycles and Resource Cleanup
#### Explanation
Properly managing component lifecycles and cleaning up resources is essential for preventing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage. Components that subscribe to events, use timers, or allocate resources should ensure that these resources are released when the component is unmounted.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that subscribes to an event and uses a timer. We will demonstrate how to manage the component lifecycle and clean up resources to prevent memory leaks.

#### Code with Resource Cleanup
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, NativeEventEmitter, NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(NativeModules.ToastExample);

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('No message yet');

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = eventEmitter.addListener('EventReminder', (event) => {
      setMessage(event.message);
    });

    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setMessage('Timer completed');
    }, 5000);

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
      clearTimeout(timer);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Component Lifecycle Management</Text>
      <Text style={styles.message}>{message}</Text>
      <Button title="Reset Message" onPress={() => setMessage('No message yet')} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  message: {
    fontSize: 18,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a message that updates based on an event and a timer. Proper cleanup of the event subscription and timer ensures that there are no memory leaks when the component is unmounted.

### Task 10: Optimize Memory Usage in Your App

#### Overview of Optimizing Memory Usage
Optimizing memory usage in mobile applications is essential to ensure smooth performance and prevent crashes, especially on devices with limited resources. Efficient memory management involves reducing memory consumption, avoiding memory leaks, and using appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle data. This not only improves the app's performance but also enhances the user experience by making the app more responsive and reliable.

In React Native, optimizing memory usage requires careful attention to how components manage state, handle large datasets, and clean up resources. Techniques such as lazy loading, memoization, and using optimized libraries can help reduce memory overhead. Additionally, monitoring and profiling memory usage during development can help identify and resolve memory-related issues early on.

#### Resources to Learn Optimizing Memory Usage
1. [React Native Performance](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance)
2. [Optimizing React Native Apps](https://blog.logrocket.com/optimizing-react-native/)

### Example 1: Lazy Loading Components
#### Explanation
Lazy loading is a technique where components or data are loaded only when they are needed, rather than all at once. This helps reduce the initial memory footprint and improves the app's loading time. In React Native, lazy loading can be implemented using the `React.lazy` function and `Suspense` component, which allow components to be loaded dynamically.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that lazily loads a heavy component only when it is needed. This demonstrates how lazy loading can optimize memory usage by deferring the loading of non-essential components.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

const App = () => {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Lazy Loading Example</Text>
      <Button title="Load Component" onPress={() => setShowComponent(true)} />
      {showComponent && (
        <Suspense fallback={<Text>Loading...</Text>}>
          <HeavyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

```javascript
// HeavyComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const HeavyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>I am a heavy component!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});

export default HeavyComponent;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, the heavy component will not be loaded initially. Users can press the "Load Component" button to load the heavy component. This demonstrates how lazy loading can optimize memory usage by deferring the loading of non-essential components.

### Example 2: Using FlatList for Efficient Rendering of Large Lists
#### Explanation
Rendering large lists efficiently is crucial for optimizing memory usage and improving performance in React Native applications. The `FlatList` component is designed to handle large datasets by rendering only the visible items and recycling the views. This helps reduce memory consumption and ensures smooth scrolling.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that uses `FlatList` to render a large dataset. We will demonstrate how `FlatList` optimizes memory usage and improves performance compared to a regular `ScrollView`.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const generateData = (count) => {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, i) => ({ key: `${i}`, value: `Item ${i}` }));
};

const data = generateData(10000);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>FlatList Example</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.value}</Text>}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.key}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    marginVertical: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a list of 10,000 items using `FlatList`. The `FlatList` component will render only the visible items and recycle views, optimizing memory usage and improving performance compared to a regular `ScrollView`.

### Example 3: Memoizing Components with React.memo
#### Explanation
Memoization is a technique used to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. In React Native, the `React.memo` function can be used to memoize functional components, preventing unnecessary re-renders and reducing memory usage.

In this example, we will create a React Native application with a component that renders a heavy computation. We will use `React.memo` to memoize the component and demonstrate how it optimizes memory usage and improves performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const HeavyComponent = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log('HeavyComponent rendered');
  return (
    <View style={styles.heavyComponent}>
      <Text>Heavy Component Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
});

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Memoization Example</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)} />
      <HeavyComponent count={count} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  heavyComponent: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderRadius: 5,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will display a button to increment the count. The `HeavyComponent` will only re-render when the count changes, thanks to `React.memo`, optimizing memory usage and improving performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### Example 1: Implementing a Basic Survey Form
#### Explanation
A basic survey form allows users to provide feedback on their experience with the app. This form can include questions about user satisfaction, suggestions for improvements, and feature requests. The collected data can be sent to a backend server for analysis.

In this example, we will create a simple survey form in React Native. The form will include text inputs and radio buttons for users to provide their feedback. The responses will be submitted to a backend server.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [satisfaction, setSatisfaction] = useState('');
  const [improvement, setImprovement] = useState('');
  const [recommendation, setRecommendation] = useState('');

  const submitSurvey = () => {
    if (satisfaction && improvement && recommendation) {
      // Send survey responses to the backend
      fetch('https://example.com/api/survey', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ satisfaction, improvement, recommendation }),
      })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          Alert.alert('Thank you for your feedback!');
          setSatisfaction('');
          setImprovement('');
          setRecommendation('');
        })
        .catch(error => {
          Alert.alert('Error submitting survey', error.message);
        });
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Please answer all questions');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>In-App Survey</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="How satisfied are you with the app? (1-5)"
        value={satisfaction}
        onChangeText={setSatisfaction}
        keyboardType="numeric"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="What can we improve?"
        value={improvement}
        onChangeText={setImprovement}
        multiline
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        placeholder="Would you recommend this app to others? (Yes/No)"
        value={recommendation}
        onChangeText={setRecommendation}
      />
      <Button title="Submit Survey" onPress={submitSurvey} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can fill out the survey with their responses and submit it. The survey responses will be sent to a backend server, and a confirmation message will be displayed to the user. This demonstrates how to implement a basic survey form in a React Native application.

### Example 2: Creating a Multi-Step Survey
#### Explanation
A multi-step survey breaks down the feedback process into smaller, more manageable parts. This approach can improve user engagement and completion rates by not overwhelming the user with too many questions at once. Each step focuses on a specific aspect of the feedback.

In this example, we will create a multi-step survey in React Native. The survey will guide the user through different steps, each collecting specific information. The responses will be stored temporarily and submitted all at once when the survey is completed.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  const [satisfaction, setSatisfaction] = useState('');
  const [improvement, setImprovement] = useState('');
  const [recommendation, setRecommendation] = useState('');

  const nextStep = () => {
    setStep(step + 1);
  };

  const previousStep = () => {
    setStep(step - 1);
  };

  const submitSurvey = () => {
    if (satisfaction && improvement && recommendation) {
      // Send survey responses to the backend
      fetch('https://example.com/api/survey', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ satisfaction, improvement, recommendation }),
      })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          Alert.alert('Thank you for your feedback!');
          setSatisfaction('');
          setImprovement('');
          setRecommendation('');
          setStep(1);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          Alert.alert('Error submitting survey', error.message);
        });
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Please answer all questions');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Multi-Step Survey</Text>
      {step === 1 && (
        <View style={styles.stepContainer}>
          <TextInput
            style={styles.input}
            placeholder="How satisfied are you with the app? (1-5)"
            value={satisfaction}
            onChangeText={setSatisfaction}
            keyboardType="numeric"
          />
          <Button title="Next" onPress={nextStep} />
        </View>
      )}
      {step === 2 && (
        <View style={styles.stepContainer}>
          <TextInput
            style={styles.input}
            placeholder="What can we improve?"
            value={improvement}
            onChangeText={setImprovement}
            multiline
          />
          <Button title="Previous" onPress={previousStep} />
          <Button title="Next" onPress={nextStep} />
        </View>
      )}
      {step === 3 && (
        <View style={styles.stepContainer}>
          <TextInput
            style={styles.input}
            placeholder="Would you recommend this app to others? (Yes/No)"
            value={recommendation}
            onChangeText={setRecommendation}
          />
          <Button title="Previous" onPress={previousStep} />
          <Button title="Submit Survey" onPress={submitSurvey} />
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  stepContainer: {
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    padding: 10,
    marginVertical: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users will be guided through a multi-step survey. Each step will collect specific feedback, and the final step will submit all responses to a backend server. This demonstrates how to implement a multi-step survey in a React Native application.

### Example 3: Integrating Third-Party Survey Tools
#### Explanation
Integrating third-party survey tools can simplify the process of collecting user feedback. Tools like SurveyMonkey, Typeform, and Google Forms offer robust features for creating and managing surveys. These tools can be embedded within your app or linked to from the app, providing a seamless feedback experience.

In this example, we will integrate a Google Form survey into a React Native app. Users will be able to access and complete the survey within the app, and the responses will be stored in Google Sheets for easy analysis.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

const App

 = () => {
  const openSurvey = () => {
    return (
      <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://forms.gle/YOUR_GOOGLE_FORM_URL' }} style={{ flex: 1 }} />
    );
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Third-Party Survey Integration</Text>
      <Button title="Open Survey" onPress={openSurvey} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can click the "Open Survey" button to access the Google Form survey within the app. This demonstrates how to integrate third-party survey tools into a React Native application for collecting user feedback.

### Task 17: Study Advanced State Management with Zustand

#### Overview of Zustand
Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React and React Native. Unlike some other state management libraries, Zustand offers a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to create and manage state without boilerplate code. Zustand is built on hooks, providing a flexible and powerful way to manage state in functional components. Its minimalistic design allows developers to manage state efficiently while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

Zustand's core features include the ability to create global state stores, subscribe to state changes, and use middleware for enhanced functionality. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous state updates, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Zustand's ease of use and performance make it an excellent choice for managing state in React Native applications, especially those that require a lightweight and scalable solution.

#### Resources to Learn Zustand
1. [Zustand GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
2. [Using Zustand for State Management](https://dev.to/frehner/using-zustand-for-state-management-in-react-4gp5)

### Example 1: Creating a Simple Global State Store
#### Explanation
Creating a global state store with Zustand involves defining a store that holds the application's state and provides methods to update and access the state. Zustand allows you to create stores with just a few lines of code, making it easy to manage global state without the need for complex setups or boilerplate.

In this example, we will create a simple global state store to manage a counter. The store will include state variables for the counter value and methods to increment and reset the counter. This demonstrates how to set up and use a Zustand store in a React Native application.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
}));

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const count = useStore((state) => state.count);
  const increment = useStore((state) => state.increment);
  const reset = useStore((state) => state.reset);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Zustand State Management</Text>
      <Text style={styles.counter}>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
      <Button title="Reset" onPress={reset} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  counter: {
    fontSize: 40,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can see the current counter value, increment it by pressing the "Increment" button, and reset it by pressing the "Reset" button. The state is managed globally using Zustand, demonstrating how to create and use a simple global state store.

### Example 2: Managing Asynchronous State Updates
#### Explanation
Zustand supports both synchronous and asynchronous state updates, making it suitable for applications that need to manage state based on asynchronous operations, such as API calls. By integrating asynchronous functions into the store, developers can manage loading states, handle errors, and update the state based on the results of these operations.

In this example, we will create a Zustand store that manages the state of a list of items fetched from an API. The store will include state variables for the items, loading status, and error messages, as well as methods to fetch the items and handle the asynchronous state updates.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  items: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  fetchItems: async () => {
    set({ loading: true, error: null });
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      const data = await response.json();
      set({ items: data, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  },
}));

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, Button, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const items = useStore((state) => state.items);
  const loading = useStore((state) => state.loading);
  const error = useStore((state) => state.error);
  const fetchItems = useStore((state) => state.fetchItems);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchItems();
  }, [fetchItems]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Zustand with Asynchronous State</Text>
      {loading && <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />}
      {error && <Text style={styles.error}>{error}</Text>}
      <FlatList
        data={items}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>}
      />
      <Button title="Reload" onPress={fetchItems} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch a list of items from the API and display them. The state store manages the loading status and error handling, providing a smooth user experience with asynchronous state updates.

2. [Handling Asynchronous State in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/)

### Example 3: Using Middleware for Enhanced State Management
#### Explanation
Middleware in Zustand allows developers to extend the functionality of state stores by intercepting actions and performing additional tasks such as logging, persistence, or undo/redo functionality. Middleware can enhance the state management capabilities of Zustand and provide more control over state changes.

In this example, we will use middleware to log state changes and persist the state to local storage. This demonstrates how to integrate middleware into a Zustand store to add advanced features.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';
import { devtools, persist } from 'zustand/middleware';

const useStore = create(
  devtools(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        count: 0,
        increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
        reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
      }),
      { name: 'counter-store' }
    )
  )
);

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const count = useStore((state) => state.count);
  const increment = useStore((state) => state.increment);
  const reset = useStore((state) => state.reset);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Zustand with Middleware</Text>
      <Text style={styles.counter}>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
      <Button title="Reset" onPress={reset} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  counter: {
    fontSize: 40,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can increment and reset the counter. The state changes will be logged to the console, and the counter value will be persisted to local storage. This demonstrates how to use middleware in Zustand to add advanced state management features.

Middleware in Zustand allows developers to extend the functionality of state stores by intercepting actions and performing additional tasks such as logging, persistence, or undo/redo functionality. Middleware can enhance the state management capabilities of Zustand and provide more control over state changes.

In this example, we will use middleware to log state changes and persist the state to local storage. This demonstrates how to integrate middleware into a Zustand store to add advanced features.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';
import { devtools, persist } from 'zustand/middleware';

const useStore = create(
  devtools(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        count: 0,
        increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
        reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),
      }),
      { name: 'counter-store' }
    )
  )
);

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const count = useStore((state) => state.count);
  const increment = useStore((state) => state.increment);
  const reset = useStore((state) => state.reset);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Zustand with Middleware</Text>
      <Text style={styles.counter}>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
      <Button title="Reset" onPress={reset} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  counter: {
    fontSize: 40,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can increment and reset the counter. The state changes will be logged to the console, and the counter value will be persisted to local storage. This demonstrates how to use middleware in Zustand to add advanced state management features.

### Task 19: Study Advanced Caching Strategies

#### Overview of Advanced Caching Strategies
Caching is a technique used to store copies of data in a temporary storage location to reduce access time and improve performance. In mobile app development, advanced caching strategies are essential for optimizing app performance, reducing server load, and providing a smoother user experience. Effective caching can minimize network requests, reduce latency, and ensure that the app remains responsive even in offline conditions.

Advanced caching strategies involve using various techniques such as in-memory caching, disk caching, and caching with expiration policies. These strategies can be implemented using libraries and tools specifically designed for caching, such as Redux Persist, AsyncStorage, and SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate). By leveraging these techniques, developers can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of their React Native applications.

### Example 1: Implementing In-Memory Caching with Zustand
#### Explanation
In-memory caching stores data in the app's memory, allowing for quick access and reducing the need to fetch data from external sources repeatedly. This type of caching is particularly useful for data that is frequently accessed and needs to be retrieved quickly. Zustand, a state management library, can be used to implement in-memory caching effectively in React Native applications.

In this example, we will create a Zustand store to cache API responses in memory. The store will include state variables for the cached data and methods to fetch and cache the data. This approach ensures that the app can quickly access the data without making repeated network requests.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  data: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  fetchData: async () => {
    set({ loading: true, error: null });
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      const data = await response.json();
      set({ data, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  },
}));

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const data = useStore((state) => state.data);
  const loading = useStore((state) => state.loading);
  const error = useStore((state) => state.error);
  const fetchData = useStore((state) => state.fetchData);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>In-Memory Caching with Zustand</Text>
      {loading && <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />}
      {error && <Text style={styles.error}>{error}</Text>}
      {data && data.map((item) => <Text key={item.id} style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>)}
      <Button title="Reload" onPress={fetchData} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the API and cache it in memory using Zustand. The data will be displayed in a list, and users can reload the data by pressing the "Reload" button. This demonstrates how to implement in-memory caching using Zustand in a React Native application.

### Example 2: Implementing Disk Caching with AsyncStorage
#### Explanation
Disk caching stores data on the device's storage, allowing for persistence across app sessions. This type of caching is useful for data that needs to be retained even when the app is closed and reopened. AsyncStorage, a built-in React Native library, can be used to implement disk caching effectively.

In this example, we will use AsyncStorage to cache API responses on the device's storage. The implementation will include methods to store, retrieve, and clear cached data. This approach ensures that the app can access cached data even after being restarted.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import create from 'zustand';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  data: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  fetchData: async () => {
    set({ loading: true, error: null });
    try {
      const cachedData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('cachedData');
      if (cachedData) {
        set({ data: JSON.parse(cachedData), loading: false });
      } else {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        const data = await response.json();
        await AsyncStorage.setItem('cachedData', JSON.stringify(data));
        set({ data, loading: false });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  },
  clearCache: async () => {
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('cachedData');
    set({ data: null });
  },
}));

export default useStore;

// App.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useStore from './store';

const App = () => {
  const data = useStore((state) => state.data);
  const loading = useStore((state) => state.loading);
  const error = useStore((state) => state.error);
  const fetchData = useStore((state) => state.fetchData);
  const clearCache = useStore((state) => state.clearCache);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Disk Caching with AsyncStorage</Text>
      {loading && <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />}
      {error && <Text style={styles.error}>{error}</Text>}
      {data && data.map((item) => <Text key={item.id} style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>)}
      <Button title="Reload" onPress={fetchData} />
      <Button title="Clear Cache" onPress={clearCache} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the API and cache it on the device's storage using AsyncStorage. The cached data will persist across app sessions, and users can reload or clear the cache by pressing the respective buttons. This demonstrates how to implement disk caching using AsyncStorage in a React Native application.

### Example 3: Implementing Caching with SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)
#### Explanation
SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) is a caching strategy that returns cached data immediately while simultaneously revalidating it in the background. This approach provides a fast and responsive user experience by displaying cached data quickly and updating it with fresh data as soon as it becomes available. The SWR library, developed by Vercel, simplifies the implementation of this strategy in React and React Native applications.

In this example, we will use the SWR library to implement the Stale-While-Revalidate caching strategy for fetching API data. The implementation will include configuring SWR to cache data and revalidate it in the background, ensuring that the app always displays the most up-to-date information.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());

const App = () => {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', fetcher);

  return (
   

 <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Caching with SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)</Text>
      {error && <Text style={styles.error}>{error.message}</Text>}
      {!data && <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />}
      {data && data.map((item) => <Text key={item.id} style={styles.item}>{item.title}</Text>)}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch data from the API using the SWR library. The data will be cached and revalidated in the background, providing a fast and responsive user experience. Users will see the cached data immediately and updated data as soon as it becomes available. This demonstrates how to implement the Stale-While-Revalidate caching strategy using SWR in a React Native application.

### Task 20: Implement Advanced Caching with Apollo Client

#### Overview of Advanced Caching with Apollo Client
Apollo Client is a powerful state management library for JavaScript applications that allows developers to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. One of its standout features is advanced caching, which helps optimize data fetching and state management. Apollo Client uses a normalized cache, which stores data in a way that allows for efficient querying and updating. This reduces the need for repeated network requests and improves the overall performance of the application.

Advanced caching strategies with Apollo Client involve setting up the cache, using cache policies, and leveraging client-side data management features. These strategies ensure that the app can provide a fast and responsive user experience by minimizing unnecessary network requests and optimizing data retrieval. Apollo Client’s caching capabilities can be customized to fit the needs of different applications, making it a versatile tool for managing state and data.

2. [Advanced Caching with Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/next-steps/advanced-caching-with-apollo-client/)

### Example 1: Setting Up Apollo Client with a Normalized Cache
#### Explanation
Setting up Apollo Client with a normalized cache involves configuring the Apollo Client to use an `InMemoryCache` for storing GraphQL query results. The `InMemoryCache` normalizes the data, making it easier to manage and query. This setup is the foundation for implementing advanced caching strategies.

In this example, we will set up Apollo Client in a React Native application and configure it to use an `InMemoryCache`. This configuration will allow us to leverage Apollo Client’s caching features for efficient data management.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider, gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

// Initialize Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const GET_POSTS = gql`
  query GetPosts {
    posts {
      data {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;

const Posts = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_POSTS);

  if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;

  return (
    <View>
      {data.posts.data.map((post) => (
        <Text key={post.id} style={styles.item}>{post.title}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Apollo Client with Normalized Cache</Text>
        <Posts />
      </View>
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will fetch posts from the GraphQL API and display them. The data will be stored in the `InMemoryCache`, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management. This demonstrates how to set up Apollo Client with a normalized cache in a React Native application.

#### Resources to Practice Setting Up Apollo Client
1. [Apollo Client Setup Guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/)
2. [InMemoryCache Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/)

### Example 2: Using Cache Policies for Efficient Data Fetching
#### Explanation
Cache policies in Apollo Client determine how the client interacts with the cache and the network. Policies such as `cache-first`, `network-only`, `cache-only`, and `cache-and-network` control whether data is fetched from the cache, the network, or both. Using the right cache policies can significantly improve the performance of the application by reducing unnecessary network requests.

In this example, we will configure a query to use the `cache-and-network` policy, which returns data from the cache first and then fetches fresh data from the network. This ensures that the user gets a fast response while still updating the data with the latest information from the server.

#### Code
```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider, gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

// Initialize Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const GET_POSTS = gql`
  query GetPosts {
    posts {
      data {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;

const Posts = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_POSTS, {
    fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network',
  });

  if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;

  return (
    <View>
      {data.posts.data.map((post) => (
        <Text key={post.id} style={styles.item}>{post.title}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Apollo Client with Cache Policies</Text>
        <Posts />
      </View>
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, it will initially fetch posts from the cache and then update them with fresh data from the network. This demonstrates how to use cache policies in Apollo Client to balance performance and data freshness.

### Example 3: Managing Client-Side Data with Apollo Client
#### Explanation
Apollo Client allows developers to manage client-side data using the same patterns and APIs used for remote data. This includes querying and mutating local data, defining type policies, and using reactive variables. By integrating local state management with Apollo Client, developers can handle both local and remote data consistently.

In this example, we will use Apollo Client to manage a simple client-side state for a counter. We will define a local type policy for the counter and create queries and mutations to update and retrieve the counter value. This demonstrates how to manage client-side state with Apollo Client.

#### Code
```javascript
// store.js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql, makeVar } from '@apollo/client';

// Reactive variable for the counter
export const counterVar = makeVar(0);

// Initialize Apollo Client
export const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api',
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Query: {
        fields: {
          counter: {
            read() {
              return counterVar();
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }),
});

// Local queries and mutations
export const GET_COUNTER = gql`
  query GetCounter {
    counter @client
  }
`;

export const INCREMENT_COUNTER = gql`
  mutation IncrementCounter {
    incrementCounter @client
  }
`;

// Client-side resolvers
client.writeQuery({
  query: GET_COUNTER,
  data: {
    counter: counterVar(),
  },
});

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloProvider, useQuery, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { client, GET_COUNTER, INCREMENT_COUNTER, counterVar } from './store';

const Counter = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(GET_COUNTER);
  const [incrementCounter] = useMutation(INCREMENT_COUNTER, {
    onCompleted: () => {
      counterVar(counterVar() + 1);
    },
  });

  return (
    <View>
      <Text style={styles.counter}>{data.counter}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCounter} />
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Client-Side Data with Apollo Client</Text>
        <Counter />
      </View>
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: '

center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  counter: {
    fontSize: 40,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
When the app is loaded, users can see the current counter value and increment it by pressing the "Increment" button. The counter state is managed locally using Apollo Client, demonstrating how to integrate client-side data management with Apollo Client.
