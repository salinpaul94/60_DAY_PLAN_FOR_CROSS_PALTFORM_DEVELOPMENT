### Example 1: Creating a Complex Sequence Animation

**Explanation:**
A complex sequence animation involves multiple steps that play in a defined order, creating a smooth transition effect. This example demonstrates how to use the Animated API to create a sequence of animations.

**Example Code:**
```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Animated, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const SequenceAnimation = () => {
  const opacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
  const translateY = useRef(new Animated.Value(-50)).current;

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.sequence([
      Animated.timing(opacity, {
        toValue: 1,
        duration: 1000,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }),
      Animated.timing(translateY, {
        toValue: 0,
        duration: 1000,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }),
    ]).start();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={[styles.box, { opacity, transform: [{ translateY }] }]}>
      <View style={styles.innerBox} />
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    margin: 50,
  },
  innerBox: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
});

export default SequenceAnimation;
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
# A red box with a blue inner box appears on the screen, fading in and sliding down smoothly.
```

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withSpring, PanGestureHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const DraggableBox = () => {
  const translateX = useSharedValue(0);
  const translateY = useSharedValue(0);

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    transform: [
      { translateX: translateX.value },
      { translateY: translateY.value },
    ],
  }));

  return (
    <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={(event) => {
      translateX.value = event.translationX;
      translateY.value = event.translationY;
    }}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />
    </PanGestureHandler>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
});

    transform: [{ translateX: translateX.value }],
  }));

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />
      <Button
        title="Animate"
        onPress={() => {
          translateX.value = withSpring(200);
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    transform: [
      { scale: scale.value },
      { rotate: `${rotate.value}deg` },
    ],
  }));

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />
      <Button
        title="Animate"
        onPress={() => {
          scale.value = withSpring(1.5);
          rotate.value = withTiming(180, { duration: 1000 });
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({

### Task 8: Implement global error boundaries

**Explanation:**
Global error boundaries catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application. They are essential for maintaining application stability, especially in production environments. Implementing global error boundaries allows developers to provide a better user experience by gracefully handling unexpected errors.

Global

 error boundaries help developers identify and log errors, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues. By providing a fallback UI, they ensure that users are not left with a broken application, improving the overall reliability and user satisfaction.

- [Error Boundaries in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)
- [React Native Error Handling](https://reactnative.dev/docs/error-handling)

### Example 1: Implementing a Global Error Boundary Component

**Explanation:**
Implementing a global error boundary involves creating a component that catches errors in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI. This example demonstrates how to create and use a global error boundary component.

**Example Code:**
```js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

class GlobalErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('GlobalErrorBoundary caught an error', error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Text>Something went wrong.</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}

const BuggyComponent = () => {
  throw new Error('I crashed!');
  return <Text>Buggy Component</Text>;
};

const App = () => (
  <GlobalErrorBoundary>
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <BuggyComponent />
    </View>
  </GlobalErrorBoundary>
);

export default App;
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
# The text "Something went wrong." appears when the BuggyComponent throws an error.
```

**Example Code:**
```js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

class GlobalErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('GlobalErrorBoundary caught an error', error, info);
    // Log the error to an external service
    logErrorToService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Text>Something went wrong.</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}

const logErrorToService = (error, info) => {
  // Send error details to a logging service
  fetch('https://example.com/log', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ error, info }),
  });
};

const BuggyComponent = () => {
  throw new Error('I crashed!');
  return <Text>Buggy Component</Text>;
};

const App = () => (
  <GlobalErrorBoundary>
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <BuggyComponent />
    </View>
  </GlobalErrorBoundary>
);

export default App;
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
# The text "Something went wrong." appears when the BuggyComponent throws an error, and the error details are logged to an external service.
```

import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const ChildComponent = ({ message }) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{message}</Text>
  </View>
);

export default ChildComponent;

// ParentComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

test('updates message on button press', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<ParentComponent />);
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Update Message'));
  expect(getByText('Hello, Jest!')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

```js
// MessageComponent.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, TextInput, Text } from 'react-native';

const MessageComponent = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Type a message"
        onChangeText={text => setMessage(text)}
        value={message}
      />
      <Button title="Clear" onPress={() => setMessage('')} />
      <Text>{message}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MessageComponent;

// MessageComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import MessageComponent from './MessageComponent';

test('updates message on input change and clears on button press', () => {
  const { getByPlaceholderText, getByText } = render(<MessageComponent />);
  const input = getByPlaceholderText('Type a message');
  fireEvent.changeText(input, 'Hello, Jest!');
  expect(getByText('Hello, Jest!')).toBeTruthy();
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Clear'));
  expect(getByText('')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

```js
// DataComponent.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, ActivityIndicator, Button } from 'react-native';

const DataComponent = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData()
      .then(response => {
        setData(response);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        setError(error);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []);

  const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
          resolve('Fetched data');
        } else {
          reject('Fetch error');
        }
      }, 1000);
    });
  };

  if (loading) {
    return <ActivityIndicator />;
  }

  if (error) {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Error: {error}</Text>
        <Button title="Retry" onPress={() => setLoading(true)} />
      </View>
    );
  }

  return <Text>{data}</Text>;
};

export default DataComponent;

// DataComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, waitFor, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import DataComponent from './DataComponent';

test('renders loading state initially', () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<DataComponent />);
  expect(getByTestId('loading')).toBeTruthy();
});

test('renders error state on fetch failure', async () => {
  jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockImplementation(() =>
    Promise.reject('Fetch error')
  );
  const { getByText, getByTestId } = render(<DataComponent />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(getByText('Error: Fetch error')).toBeTruthy());
  global.fetch.mockRestore();
});

test('renders data state on fetch success', async () => {
  jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockImplementation(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      json: () => Promise.resolve('Fetched data'),
    })
  );
  const { getByText } = render(<DataComponent />);
  await waitFor(() => expect(getByText('Fetched data')).toBeTruthy());
  global.fetch.mockRestore();
});
```

**Example Code:**
```js
// ListComponent.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const ListComponent = ({ initialItems }) => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);
  const [newItem, setNewItem] = useState('');

  const addItem = () => {
    setItems([...items, newItem]);
    setNewItem('');
  };

      <FlatList
        data={items}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
      />
      <TextInput
        value={newItem}
        onChangeText={setNewItem}
        placeholder="Add new item"
      />
      <Button title="Add" onPress={addItem} />
    </View>
  );
};

export

 default ListComponent;

// ListComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import ListComponent from './ListComponent';

test('renders initial items', () => {
  const initialItems = ['Item 1', 'Item 2'];
  const { getByText } = render(<ListComponent initialItems={initialItems} />);
  expect(getByText('Item 1')).toBeTruthy();
  expect(getByText('Item 2')).toBeTruthy();
});

test('adds new item to the list', () => {
  const initialItems = ['Item 1'];
  const { getByPlaceholderText, getByText } = render(<ListComponent initialItems={initialItems} />);
  fireEvent.changeText(getByPlaceholderText('Add new item'), 'Item 2');
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Add'));
  expect(getByText('Item 2')).toBeTruthy();
});
```
**Expected Output:**

describe('Navigation Flow', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
  });

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
  });

  it('should navigate to the details screen', async () => {
    await element(by.id('home_button')).tap();
    await expect(element(by.id('details_screen'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button, Text } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => (
  <View>
    <Button
      title="Go to Details"
      testID="home_button"
      onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
    />
  </View>
);

const DetailsScreen = () => (
  <View>
    <Text testID="details_screen">Details Screen</Text>
  </View>
);

const App = () => (
  <NavigationContainer>
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  </NavigationContainer>
);

export default App;
```
