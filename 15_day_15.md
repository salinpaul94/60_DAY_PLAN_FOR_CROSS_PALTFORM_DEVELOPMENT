### Task 1: Study React Native CLI commands

**Explanation:**
The React Native Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows developers to create, build, and manage React Native projects. It provides various commands for common development tasks such as initializing new projects, running applications on simulators and devices, linking native dependencies, and more. Understanding and utilizing the React Native CLI can significantly streamline the development workflow and improve productivity.

Studying the React Native CLI commands is essential for efficient project management and development. It allows developers to perform a wide range of tasks directly from the terminal, reducing the need for manual setup and configuration. Mastering these commands can help automate repetitive tasks and ensure a smooth development experience.

  }
}' > package.json
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to create a script to automate the build process for iOS and Android. The `package.json` file is updated with custom scripts that run the React Native CLI commands for building the app in release mode.

**Example 2: Automating Tests with Scripts**
```bash
# Create a script to automate running tests
echo '{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}' > package.json

                type === Camera.Constants.Type.back
                  ? Camera.Constants.Type.front
                  : Camera.Constants.Type.back
              );
            }}>
          </Button>
        </View>
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to use the Camera API from the Expo SDK. The app requests camera permissions, displays the camera view, and allows the user to flip between the front and back cameras.

**Example 2: Using the Location API**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

export default function App() {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      let { status } = await Location.requestPermissionsAsync();
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        setLocation('Permission

 to access location was denied');
        return;
      }

      let loc = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
      setLocation(loc);
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Location: {JSON.stringify(location)}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to use the Location API from the Expo SDK. The app requests location permissions and displays the current location of the device.
