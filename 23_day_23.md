### Task 1: Review TypeScript in React Native

**Explanation:**
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static types to the language, enabling developers to catch errors early through static analysis. TypeScript is particularly useful in large codebases where maintaining type safety and understanding the code's structure is crucial. In React Native, TypeScript helps in building more robust and maintainable applications by ensuring that the components and logic adhere to defined types.

Reviewing TypeScript in React Native involves understanding how to set up a TypeScript project, how to use type definitions, and how to leverage TypeScript features like interfaces, generics, and utility types to enhance the development experience. This knowledge helps developers to write more predictable and error-free code, improving the overall quality of the application.
