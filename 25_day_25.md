```jsx
// Original complex code
const processItems = (items) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    if (items[i].active) {
      console.log(`Processing item ${items[i].name}`);
    }
  }
};

// Refactored code
const processActiveItems = (items) => {
  items.filter(item => item.active).forEach(item => {
    console.log(`Processing item ${item.name}`);
  });
};

processActiveItems(items);
```
Output: Refactors complex logic by breaking it down into smaller, reusable functions.

// Original redundant code
const addItem = (list, item) => {
  list.push(item);
};

const addNewItem = (list, item) => {
  list.push(item);
};

// Refactored code
const addItem = (list, item) => {
  list.push(item);
};

addItem(list, item);
```
