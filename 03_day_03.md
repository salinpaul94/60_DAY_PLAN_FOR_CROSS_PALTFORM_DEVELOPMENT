### Task 1: Study advanced array methods (`filter`, `reduce`, `find`)

**Explanation:**
Advanced array methods like `filter`, `reduce`, and `find` provide powerful ways to manipulate and interact with arrays in JavaScript. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. This is useful for creating a subset of elements from an existing array based on certain conditions.

The `reduce` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. This method is versatile and can be used for various operations such as summing elements, creating an object, or flattening an array. The `find` method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, `undefined` is returned.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
- [MDN Web Docs: Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
- [MDN Web Docs: Array.prototype.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example uses the `filter` method to create a new array `evenNumbers` that contains only the even numbers from the original `numbers` array. The `filter` method applies the provided function to each element, and only elements that pass the test (number % 2 === 0) are included in the new array.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
const prices = [29.76, 41.85, 46.5];
const total = prices.reduce((sum, price) => sum + price, 0);
console.log(total); // 118.11
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example uses the `reduce` method to calculate the total sum of the `prices` array. The `reduce` method applies the provided function to each element, accumulating the sum starting with an initial value of 0. The final result is the total sum of all prices.

**Resources:**
- [JavaScript.info: Array methods](https://javascript.info/array-methods)
- [W3Schools: JavaScript Array Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)

### Task 2: Practice using advanced array methods

**Explanation:**
Practicing advanced array methods helps you understand how to manipulate arrays effectively. The `filter`, `reduce`, and `find` methods allow you to perform complex operations with concise and readable code. Regular practice ensures you can use these methods to solve real-world problems efficiently.

Using these methods also helps you think in a functional programming style, which is beneficial for writing clean and maintainable code. It encourages the use of immutability and side-effect-free functions, which are key principles in modern JavaScript development.

const students = [
  { name: 'Alice', score: 85 },
  { name: 'Bob', score: 92 },
  { name: 'Charlie', score: 60 }
];
const highScorers = students.filter(student => student.score > 80);
console.log(highScorers); // [{ name: 'Alice', score: 85 }, { name: 'Bob', score: 92 }]
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example uses the `filter` method to create a new array `highScorers` that contains only the students with scores greater than 80. The `filter` method applies the provided function to each student object, and only those that pass the test (student.score > 80) are included in the new array.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
const transactions = [5, 10, 15];
const balance = transactions.reduce((total, transaction) => total + transaction, 100);
console.log(balance); // 130
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example uses the `reduce` method to calculate the total balance after applying the transactions. The `reduce` method applies the provided function to each transaction, accumulating the sum starting with an initial balance of 100. The final result is the total balance.

### Task 3: Learn about higher-order functions

**Explanation:**
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. They are a key feature of functional programming and enable powerful abstractions for managing code complexity. Common higher-order functions in JavaScript include `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which take functions as arguments and apply them to arrays.

Higher-order functions allow for more modular and reusable code. They enable the creation of function pipelines, where the output of one function is the input to another. This leads to cleaner, more readable, and maintainable code. Understanding higher-order functions is essential for leveraging the full power of JavaScript.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Higher-order functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Higher-order_function)
- [JavaScript.info: Higher-order functions](https://javascript.info/function-properties-methods#higher-order-functions)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
function greaterThan(n) {
  return function(m) {
    return m > n;
  };
}
const greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greaterThan10(11)); // true
console.log(greaterThan10(9)); // false
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a higher-order function `greaterThan` that returns a function checking if a number is greater than `n`. The `greaterThan10` function is created by calling `greaterThan(10)`. It is then used to check if 11 and 9 are greater than 10, returning `true` and `false`, respectively.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function applyOperation(arr, operation) {
  return arr.map(operation);
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squares = applyOperation(numbers, x => x * x);
console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a higher-order function `applyOperation` that takes an array and an operation function. It applies the operation to each element of the array using `map`. The `applyOperation` function is used to square each number in the `numbers` array, resulting in the `squares` array.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)
- [Codecademy: Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
true
false
```
For Example 2:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Task 4: Write functions that return other functions

**Explanation:**
Writing functions that return other functions is a common practice in functional programming. These functions are known as higher-order functions. They enable the creation of reusable and configurable logic by allowing functions to be customized with parameters and returned as new functions.

Higher-order functions that return other functions can be used to create factories, decorators, and various utility functions. They promote code reuse and modularity by encapsulating logic in a way that can be easily reused and adapted to different contexts.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Higher-order functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Higher-order_function)
- [JavaScript.info: Higher-order functions](https://javascript.info/function-properties-methods#higher-order-functions)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}
const multiplyBy2 = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(multiplyBy2(5)); // 10
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a higher-order function `multiplyBy` that returns a function multiplying a number by the given `factor`. The `multiplyBy2`

 function is created by calling `multiplyBy(2)`. It is then used to multiply 5 by 2, returning 10.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function greet(greeting) {
  return function(name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };
}
const sayHello = greet('Hello');
console.log(sayHello('Alice')); // "Hello, Alice!"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a higher-order function `greet` that returns a function generating a greeting message. The `sayHello` function is created by calling `greet('Hello')`. It is then used to greet "Alice", returning "Hello, Alice!".

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
10
```
For Example 2:
```
"Hello, Alice!"
```

### Task 5: Study the concept of closures

**Explanation:**
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures are created whenever a function is defined inside another function and the inner function references variables from the outer function's scope. This powerful feature allows for data encapsulation and the creation of private variables and functions.

Closures are useful for maintaining state between function calls, implementing data hiding, and creating function factories. They enable functions to remember the environment in which they were created, which can be leveraged for various programming patterns such as memoization and currying.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
- [JavaScript.info: Closures](https://javascript.info/closure)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}
const increment = counter();
console.log(increment()); // 1
console.log(increment()); // 2
console.log(increment()); // 3
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `counter` that returns a function incrementing a private `count` variable. The `increment` function is a closure that retains access to `count`, allowing it to maintain state between calls. Each call to `increment` increases and returns the `count`.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function createGreeting(message) {
  return function(name) {
    return `${message}, ${name}!`;
  };
}
const greetHello = createGreeting('Hello');
console.log(greetHello('Alice')); // "Hello, Alice!"
console.log(greetHello('Bob')); // "Hello, Bob!"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `createGreeting` that returns a function generating a greeting message. The returned function is a closure that retains access to the `message` variable. The `greetHello` function can be used to greet different names with the same message.

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
1
2
3
```
For Example 2:
```
"Hello, Alice!"
"Hello, Bob!"
```

### Task 6: Create and use closures

**Explanation:**
Creating and using closures involves defining functions within other functions and ensuring that the inner functions reference variables from the outer function's scope. This practice allows the inner function to retain access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures are powerful tools for encapsulating data and creating private states. They are widely used in JavaScript for various purposes, such as event handlers, callback functions, and module patterns. Understanding how to create and use closures effectively is crucial for writing advanced JavaScript code.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
- [JavaScript.info: Closures](https://javascript.info/closure)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment() {
      count += 1;
      return count;
    },
    decrement() {
      count -= 1;
      return count;
    }
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 0
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `createCounter` that returns an object with `increment` and `decrement` methods. Both methods are closures that retain access to the private `count` variable. The `counter` object can increment and decrement the `count` while keeping it private.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function greetingGenerator(greeting) {
  return function(name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
  };
}
const sayHi = greetingGenerator('Hi');
console.log(sayHi('Alice')); // "Hi, Alice!"
console.log(sayHi('Bob')); // "Hi, Bob!"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `greetingGenerator` that returns a function generating a greeting message. The returned function is a closure that retains access to the `greeting` variable. The `sayHi` function can be used to greet different names with the same greeting.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: JavaScript Closures](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding JavaScript Closures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-javascript-closures-8fc71dd1a98e/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
1
0
```
For Example 2:
```
"Hi, Alice!"
"Hi, Bob!"
```

### Task 7: Understand `this` keyword

**Explanation:**
The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value depends on how the function is called. In a global context, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers). Inside a method, `this` refers to the object that owns the method. In an event handler, `this` refers to the element that received the event.

Understanding the behavior of `this` is crucial for writing correct and predictable code, especially in object-oriented programming and event-driven applications. The value of `this` can be explicitly set using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` methods.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
- [JavaScript.info: this](https://javascript.info/this)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an object `person` with a `greet` method. Inside the `greet` method, `this` refers to the `person` object, allowing access to its `name` property. The `greet` method prints a greeting message using the `name` property.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function globalGreet() {
  console.log(this); // In strict mode: undefined, otherwise: window
}
globalGreet();
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `globalGreet` that logs the value of `this`. When called in the global context, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, `this` is `undefined` in a regular function.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: JavaScript this Keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)
- [Codecademy: Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
"Hello, my name is Alice"
```
For Example 2:
```
Window object or undefined (in strict mode)
```

---

### Task 8: Practice different contexts of `this`

**Explanation:**
Practicing different contexts of `this` involves understanding how `this` behaves in various scenarios such as method calls, constructor functions, event handlers, and regular functions. The value of `this` can change depending on how and where the function is called.

Understanding these different contexts helps you avoid common pitfalls and write more predictable code. It also enables you to leverage `this` effectively in object-oriented programming and event-driven applications.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
- [JavaScript.info: this](https://javascript.info/this)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 42,
  showValue() {
    console.log(this.value);
  }
};
const showValue = obj.showValue;
showValue(); // undefined (or error in strict mode)
obj.showValue(); // 42
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how `this`

 behaves in a method call versus a function call. When `showValue` is called as a method of `obj`, `this` refers to `obj`, and it prints `42`. When `showValue` is called as a standalone function, `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const alice = new Person('Alice');
console.log(alice.name); // "Alice"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how `this` behaves in a constructor function. When `Person` is called with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created object. The `name` property is set on the new object, and the `alice` instance has the `name` property set to "Alice".

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: JavaScript this Keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)
- [Codecademy: Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
undefined (or error in strict mode)
42
```
For Example 2:
```
"Alice"
```

---

### Task 9: Learn about the `bind` method

**Explanation:**
The `bind` method in JavaScript is used to create a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. This allows you to explicitly set the value of `this` for a function, ensuring it behaves as expected regardless of how or where it is called.

Using `bind` is useful for maintaining the correct `this` context in callback functions, event handlers, and methods passed as arguments. It ensures that the function retains the intended `this` value, making the code more predictable and easier to understand.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Function.prototype.bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)
- [JavaScript.info: Bind](https://javascript.info/bind)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
const greet = person.greet.bind(person);
greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an object `person` with a `greet` method. The `bind` method is used to create a new function `greet` with `this` set to `person`. When `greet` is called, `this` refers to `person`, and it prints the greeting message.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function logThis() {
  console.log(this);
}
const boundLogThis = logThis.bind({ value: 42 });
boundLogThis(); // { value: 42 }
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `logThis` that logs the value of `this`. The `bind` method is used to create a new function `boundLogThis` with `this` set to an object `{ value: 42 }`. When `boundLogThis` is called, `this` refers to the provided object.

- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding the bind method](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-javascript-s-bind-method/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
"Hello, my name is Alice"
```
For Example 2:
```
{ value: 42 }
```

---

### Task 10: Use `bind` to control `this`

**Explanation:**
Using `bind` to control `this` involves creating functions with a fixed `this` value, ensuring that the function behaves consistently regardless of how or where it is called. This is particularly useful in event handlers, callbacks, and methods passed as arguments.

Practicing the use of `bind` helps you understand how to manage the `this` context in various scenarios. It allows you to write more predictable and maintainable code by ensuring that functions always have the correct `this` value.

**Resources:**

```javascript
const button = {
  text: 'Click me',
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this.text);
  }
};
const boundHandleClick = button.handleClick.bind(button);
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', boundHandleClick);
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an object `button` with a `handleClick` method. The `bind` method is used to create a new function `boundHandleClick` with `this` set to `button`. When the button is clicked, `this` refers to `button`, and it logs the `text` property.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function showValue() {
  console.log(this.value);
}
const obj = { value: 100 };
const boundShowValue = showValue.bind(obj);
boundShowValue(); // 100
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `showValue` that logs the value of `this.value`. The `bind` method is used to create a new function `boundShowValue` with `this` set to an object `{ value: 100 }`. When `boundShowValue` is called, `this` refers to the provided object.

For Example 1:
```
Logs "Click me" when the button is clicked
```
For Example 2:
```
100
```

---

### Task 11: Study call and apply methods

**Explanation:**
The `call` and `apply` methods in JavaScript are used to invoke functions with a specific `this` value and arguments. The `call` method takes the `this` value as the first argument, followed by a list of arguments. The `apply` method takes the `this` value as the first argument and an array of arguments as the second argument.

Using `call` and `apply` allows you to explicitly set the `this` value for a function, providing flexibility in how functions are executed. These methods are useful for borrowing methods from other objects, invoking functions with different contexts, and working with variadic functions.

**Resources:**

**Example 1:**
```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
}
const person = { name: 'Alice' };
greet.call(person); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `greet` that logs a greeting message using `this.name`. The `call` method is used to invoke `greet` with `this` set to the `person` object. The `greet` function logs "Hello, my name is Alice".

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const result = sum.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(result); // 6
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `sum` that adds three numbers. The `apply` method is used to invoke `sum` with `null` as the `this` value and `numbers` array as the arguments. The `sum` function returns the sum of the numbers, which is `6`.

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
const anotherPerson = { name: 'Bob' };
person.greet.call(anotherPerson); // "Hello, my name is Bob"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an object `person` with a `greet` method. The `call` method is used to invoke `greet` with `this` set to `anotherPerson`. The `greet` method logs "Hello, my name is Bob".

**Example 2:**
```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
const values = [2, 3];
const product = multiply.apply(null, values);
console.log(product); // 6
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a function `multiply` that multiplies two numbers. The `apply` method is used to invoke `multiply` with `null` as the `this` value and `values` array as the arguments. The `multiply` function returns the product of the numbers, which is `6`.

### Task 13: Learn about classes in ES6

**Explanation:**
Classes in ES6 provide a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model. They offer a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance. The `class` keyword is used to define a class, and the `constructor` method is used to initialize object properties. Methods can be defined within the class body.

Classes make it easier to create and manage objects and their prototypes. They improve code readability and maintainability by providing a structured way to define and extend objects. Understanding classes is essential for writing modern JavaScript code, especially in frameworks like React.

**Resources:**

### Task 14: Create and use classes

**Explanation:**
Creating and using classes involves defining a class with properties and methods, and then creating instances of the class. Classes provide a structured way to create objects with shared properties and behavior. The `class` keyword is used to define the class, and the `constructor` method is used to initialize the properties.

Using classes makes your code more organized and easier to maintain. It allows you to define reusable blueprints for objects, encapsulating their behavior and properties. Practicing creating and using classes helps you understand object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

class Animal {
  constructor(name, species) {
    this.name = name;
    this.species = species;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}
const dog = new Animal('Rex', 'Dog');
dog.makeSound(); // "Rex makes a sound."
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an `Animal` class with a `constructor` method to initialize `name` and `species` properties. The `makeSound` method logs a message using these properties. An instance of the class is created with the name "Rex" and species "Dog", and the `makeSound` method is called on the instance.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }

### Task 15: Study inheritance with classes

**Explanation:**
Inheritance in classes allows you to create new classes that extend existing ones. The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a parent class. The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class.

Inheritance promotes code reuse and helps organize code in a hierarchical manner. It allows you to build on existing functionality and create specialized subclasses that add or override properties and methods. Understanding inheritance is crucial for writing modular and maintainable object-oriented code.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Inheritance)
- [JavaScript.info: Class inheritance](https://javascript.info/class-inheritance)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const rex = new Dog('Rex');
rex.makeSound(); // "Rex barks."
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an `Animal` class with a `makeSound` method. The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and overrides the `makeSound` method to provide a specialized behavior. An instance of `Dog` is created with the name "Rex", and the `makeSound` method is called on the instance.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Vehicle: ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
myCar.displayInfo(); // "Car: Toyota Corolla"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Vehicle` class with a `displayInfo` method. The `Car` class extends `Vehicle` and overrides the `displayInfo` method to provide a specialized behavior. An instance of `Car` is created with the make "Toyota" and model "Corolla", and the `displayInfo` method is called on the instance.

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  introduce() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}.`);
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, major) {
    super(name);
    this.major = major;
  }

  introduce() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm studying ${this.major}.`);
  }
}

const student = new Student('Alice', 'Computer Science');
student.introduce(); // "Hi, I'm Alice and I'm studying Computer Science."
```

This example defines a `Person` class with an `introduce` method. The `Student` class extends `Person`, adds a `major` property, and overrides the `introduce` method to include the major. An instance of `Student` is created with the name "Alice" and major "Computer Science", and the `introduce` method is called on the instance.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class Shape {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  describe() {
    console.log(`This is a ${this.color} shape.`);
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(color, radius) {
    super(color);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  describe() {
    console.log(`This is a ${this.color} circle with a radius of ${this.radius}.`);
  }
}

const circle = new Circle('red', 5);
circle.describe(); // "This is a red circle with a radius of 5."

### Task 17: Learn about getters and setters

**Explanation:**
Getters and setters are special methods in JavaScript classes that provide a way to access and update properties. The `get` keyword is used to define a getter method that retrieves the value of a property, while the `set` keyword is used to define a setter method that updates the value of a property.

Getters and setters allow you to control how properties are accessed and modified. They provide encapsulation and can include validation or other logic when getting or setting a property. Understanding getters and setters is important for creating robust and maintainable classes.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: Getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)
- [MDN Web Docs: Setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
  }
}

const person = new Person('Alice');
console.log(person.name); // "Alice"
person.name = 'Bob';
console.log(person.name); // "Bob"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Person` class with a private `_name` property. The getter method `name` retrieves the value of `_name`, and the setter method `name` updates the value of `_name`. An instance of `Person` is created with the name "Alice", and the name is updated to "Bob" using the setter method.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this._width = width;
    this._height = height;
  }

  get area() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }

  set width(newWidth) {
    this._width = newWidth;
  }

  set height(newHeight) {
    this._height = newHeight;
  }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(rect.area); // 50
rect.width = 7;
rect.height = 3;
console.log(rect.area); // 21
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Rectangle` class with private `_width` and `_height` properties. The getter method `area` calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. The setter methods `width` and `height` update the dimensions of the rectangle. An instance of `Rectangle` is created with a width of 10 and height of 5, and the area is updated after changing the dimensions.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this._username = username;
  }

  get username() {
    return this._username;
  }

  set username(newUsername) {
    if (newUsername.length >= 3) {
      this._username = newUsername;
    } else {
      console.log('Username must be at least 3 characters long');
    }
  }
}

const user = new User('John');
console.log(user.username); // "John"
user.username = 'Al'; // "Username must be at least 3 characters long"
console.log(user.username); // "John"
user.username = 'Alex';
console.log(user.username); // "Alex"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `User` class with a private `_username` property. The getter method `username` retrieves the value of `_username`, and the setter method `username` updates the value of `_username` with validation. An instance of `User` is created with the username "John", and the username is updated to "Alex" after a failed attempt to set a short username.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class Product {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this._name = name;
    this._price = price;
  }

  get price() {
    return this._price;
  }

  set price(newPrice) {
    if (newPrice > 0) {
      this._price = newPrice;
    } else {
      console.log('Price must be positive');
    }
  }

  get info() {
    return `Product: ${this._name}, Price: $${this._price}`;
  }
}

const product = new Product('Laptop', 1000);
console.log(product.info); // "Product: Laptop, Price: $1000"
product.price = -500; // "Price must be positive"
console.log(product.info); // "Product: Laptop, Price: $1000"
product.price = 1200;
console.log(product.info); // "Product: Laptop, Price: $1200"
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Product` class with private `_name` and `_price` properties. The getter method `price` retrieves the value of `_price`, and the setter method `price` updates the value of `_price` with validation. The getter method `info` returns a formatted string with the product's details. An instance of `Product` is created with the name "Laptop" and price 1000, and the price

### Task 19: Study static methods

**Explanation:**
Static methods are functions defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They are used to create utility functions that are related to the class but do not require an instance to operate. Static methods are defined using the `static` keyword within the class body.

Static methods provide a way to organize and encapsulate functions that belong to a class but do not operate on instance-specific data. They can be used for tasks like creating objects, performing calculations, or handling utility operations related to the class.

**Resources:**
- [MDN Web Docs: static](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)
- [JavaScript.info: Static properties and methods](https://javascript.info/static-properties-methods)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 3)); // 8
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `MathUtils` class with a static `add` method. The `add` method performs addition and is called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class. The `console.log` statement prints the result of adding 5 and 3.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
class DateUtils {
  static getCurrentDate() {
    return new Date().toDateString();
  }
}

console.log(DateUtils.getCurrentDate()); // Current date in string format
```

**Example Explanation:**
