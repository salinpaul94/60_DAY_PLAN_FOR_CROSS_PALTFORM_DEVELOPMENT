### Task 1: Study advanced state management techniques

**Explanation:**
Advanced state management techniques involve using patterns and libraries to manage complex application state in a scalable and maintainable way. This includes using state management libraries like Redux, MobX, and Zustand, as well as advanced concepts like selectors, middleware, and context-based state management.

Understanding advanced state management techniques helps you build applications that can handle large amounts of data and user interactions efficiently. It ensures that your application remains responsive and maintainable as it grows in complexity.

**Resources:**
- [Redux Advanced Techniques](https://redux.js.org/advanced/advanced-tutorial)
- [MobX Advanced Patterns](https://mobx.js.org/best/store.html)

**Example 1: Using Selectors with Redux**
Implement selectors in a Redux store to efficiently derive and compute state. Selectors help manage complex state by providing memoized, reusable, and composable functions.

**Example Explanation:**
Selectors improve performance by memoizing derived state, reducing unnecessary re-renders. They also make state management more modular and easier to test.

**Example 2: Using Computed Values in MobX**
Implement computed values in MobX to derive state based on observable values. Computed values automatically update when their dependencies change.

**Example Explanation:**
Computed values in MobX help keep state consistent and reactive, automatically updating derived values when their dependencies change. This reduces boilerplate and improves code readability.

**Resources:**
- [Redux Selectors](https://redux.js.org/recipes/computing-derived-data)
- [MobX Computed Values](https://mobx.js.org/the-gist-of-mobx.html#computed-values)

**Expected Output:**
For Using Selectors with Redux:
```sh
# Implement selectors in a Redux store
```
```js
// selectors.js
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const selectUsers = state => state.users;

const selectActiveUsers = createSelector(
  [selectUsers],
  users => users.filter(user => user.active)
);

export { selectActiveUsers };
```
Output: Implements selectors to efficiently derive and compute state in a Redux store.

For Using Computed Values in MobX:
```sh
# Implement computed values in MobX
```
```js
// store.js
import { makeAutoObservable } from 'mobx';

class UserStore {
  users = [];

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }

  get activeUsers() {
    return this.users.filter(user => user.active);
  }

  addUser(user) {
    this.users.push(user);
  }
}

const userStore = new UserStore();
export default userStore;
```
Output: Implements computed values to derive state based on observable values in MobX.

### Task 2: Implement advanced state management patterns

**Explanation:**
Implementing advanced state management patterns involves using sophisticated techniques and libraries to handle complex state requirements. This includes patterns like state normalization, using middleware for side effects, and combining multiple state management solutions.

Advanced state management patterns help you maintain a clean and scalable architecture, making it easier to manage and update the application as it grows. These patterns provide structured approaches to handle complex state logic efficiently.

**Resources:**
- [State Normalization in Redux](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape)
- [Combining State Management Solutions](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)

**Example 1: Normalizing State in Redux**
Normalize the state in a Redux store to avoid nested structures and make state updates more predictable and efficient.

**Example Explanation:**
Normalizing state involves flattening nested state structures, making it easier to update and manage. This reduces complexity and improves performance by avoiding deep updates.

**Example 2: Combining Context API and Redux**
Combine the Context API with Redux to manage global state and context-specific state separately, leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

**Example Explanation:**
Combining Context API and Redux allows you to manage different types of state more effectively. Context API handles context-specific state, while Redux manages global state, providing a balanced and scalable solution.

**Resources:**
- [State Normalization in Redux](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape)
- [Combining State Management Solutions](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)

**Expected Output:**
For Normalizing State in Redux:
```sh
# Normalize the state in a Redux store
```
```js
// state.js
const initialState = {
  users: {
    byId: {},
    allIds: [],
  },
};

const addUser = (state, action) => {
  const { user } = action.payload;
  state.users.byId[user.id] = user;
  state.users.allIds.push(user.id);
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_USER':
      addUser(state, action);
      return { ...state };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default reducer;
```
Output: Normalizes state in a Redux store to avoid nested structures.

For Combining Context API and Redux:
```sh
# Combine Context API with Redux to manage different types of state
```
```js
// context.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';
import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './reduxStore';

const Context = createContext();

const initialState = { theme: 'light' };

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'TOGGLE_THEME':
      return { ...state, theme: state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light' };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const ContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <Context.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      <ReduxProvider store={store}>{children}</ReduxProvider>
    </Context.Provider>
  );
};

const useGlobalContext = () => useContext(Context);

export { ContextProvider, useGlobalContext };
```
Output: Combines Context API and Redux to manage global and context-specific state separately.

### Task 3: Study middleware in state management

**Explanation:**
Middleware in state management acts as an intermediary layer between the dispatching of an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. It allows you to handle side effects like asynchronous actions, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns. Middleware can be used in libraries like Redux to enhance functionality and manage complex workflows.

Studying middleware helps you understand how to handle side effects in a scalable and maintainable way. It enables you to separate concerns, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage.

- [Understanding Redux Middleware](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/01/idiomatic-redux-thoughts-on-thunks-sagas-abstraction-and-reusability/)

**Example 1: Creating Custom Middleware in Redux**
Create custom middleware in Redux to log actions and manage side effects. Custom middleware can handle tasks like authentication, API calls, and analytics.

**Example Explanation:**
Creating custom middleware involves defining functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer. This allows you to perform tasks like logging, handling asynchronous actions, and more.

**Example 2: Using Redux Thunk Middleware**
Use Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions in a Redux application. Redux Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

**Example Explanation:**
Using Redux Thunk simplifies managing asynchronous actions, such as API calls, by allowing action creators to return functions that dispatch actions based on the outcome of asynchronous operations.

**Resources:**
- [Redux Middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware)
- [Redux Thunk Documentation](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

**Expected Output:**
For Creating Custom Middleware in Redux:
```sh
# Create custom middleware to log actions and manage side effects
```
```js
// loggerMiddleware.js
const loggerMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log('Dispatching action:', action);
  const result = next(action);
  console.log('Next state:', store.getState());
  return result;
};

export default loggerMiddleware;
```
Output: Creates custom middleware in Redux to log actions and manage side effects.

For Using Redux Thunk Middleware:
```sh
# Use Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions
```
```js
// store.js
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));

export default store;
```
```js
// actions.js
export const fetchUser = userId => async dispatch => {
  dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_REQUEST' });
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const user = await response.json();
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', payload: user });
  } catch (error) {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_FAILURE', error });
  }
};
```
Output: Uses Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions in a Redux application.

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Message {
    content: String!
  }

  type Query {
    messages: [Message!]
  }

  type Subscription {
    messageAdded: Message
  }

  type Mutation {
    addMessage(content: String!): Message
  }
`;
