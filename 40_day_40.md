**Explanation:**
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication. It allows third-party services to exchange data without exposing user credentials. Implementing OAuth authentication helps secure your application by enabling users to authenticate using their existing accounts from other services, such as Google or Facebook.

By using OAuth, you can enhance the security of your application, provide a better user experience, and reduce the burden of managing user credentials. OAuth tokens are short-lived, reducing the risk of compromised credentials and providing a more secure authentication mechanism.

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, world!',
  },
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  plugins: [{
    requestDidStart: () => ({
      didResolveOperation({ request, document }) {
        const complexity = getComplexity({
          schema,
          query: document,
          variables: request.variables,
          estimators: [
            simpleEstimator({ defaultComplexity: 1 }),
          ],
        });

        if (complexity > 20) {
          throw new Error(`Query is too complex: ${complexity}. Maximum allowed complexity: 20`);
        }
      },
    }),
  }],
});

const app = express();
server.start().then(() => {
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
  });
});
```

**Example Code:**
```sh
# Install necessary packages
npm install graphql-depth-limit

# server.js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const depthLimit = require('graphql-depth-limit');
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('@graphql-tools/schema');

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, world!',
  },
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  validationRules: [depthLimit(3)],
});

const app = express();
server.start().then(() => {
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
  });
});
```

});

app.use('/graphql', limiter);

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.start().then(() => {
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
