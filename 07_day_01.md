2. [MDN Web Docs - Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)

**Example 1: Declaring a Function**
1. **Function Declaration:** Declare a function using the `function` keyword.
2. **Calling a Function:** Call the function to execute its code.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Declaring a function defines the block of code to be executed when the function is called. Calling the function runs the code within it. Functions can take arguments to customize their behavior and return values to provide results.

**Example 2: Arrow Functions**
1. **Arrow Function Syntax:** Declare a function using the arrow function syntax.
2. **Using Arrow Functions:** Use an arrow function to perform a task.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, especially useful for inline functions and callbacks. They also have different behavior regarding the `this` keyword, making them suitable for certain use cases.

**Online Resources:**

2. [JavaScript Function Expressions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_expressions.asp)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Declaring a Function
function greet(name) {
    return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
}
let greeting = greet('Alice');
console.log(greeting);
// Expected Output: Hello, Alice!
```

```js
// Arrow Functions
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
let result = multiply(4, 5);
console.log(result);
// Expected Output: 20
```

#### Task 12: JavaScript Control Structures
**Explanation:**
Control structures in JavaScript are used to control the flow of the program. Common control structures include conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`). These structures allow you to execute code based on conditions and repeat code multiple times.

Conditional statements execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. Loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Mastering these control structures is essential for writing dynamic and flexible JavaScript code.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Conditionals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)
2. [JavaScript Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

**Example 1: Conditional Statements**
1. **If-Else Statement:** Use an `if-else` statement to execute code based on a condition.
2. **Else If Statement:** Use `else if` to check multiple conditions.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Conditional statements allow you to branch your code based on different conditions. The `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, it executes a block of code. The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.

**Example 2: Loops**
1. **For Loop:** Use a `for` loop to repeat a block of code a specified number of times.
2. **While Loop:** Use a `while` loop to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Loops are used to repeat code multiple times. A `for` loop is useful when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat the block of code. A `while` loop repeats the block of code as long as the specified condition remains true.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Conditional Statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)

```js
// Conditional Statements
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log('A');
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log('B');
} else {
    console.log('C');
}
// Expected Output: B
```

```js
// Loops
// For Loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log('Iteration ' + i);
}
// Expected Output: 
// Iteration 0

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Creating a Simple RESTful API
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

let items = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }
];

app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
    res.json(items);
});

app.post('/items', (req, res) => {
    const newItem = { id: items.length + 1, name: req.body.name };
    items.push(newItem);
    res.status(201).json(newItem);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

// Expected Output:
// Server is running on port 3000

// Use a tool like Postman to send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/items
// Expected Output: [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }]

// Use a tool like Postman to send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/items with JSON body { "name": "Item 3" }
// Expected Output: { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' }
```

```js
// Sending JSON Responses
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

let items = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }
];

app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
    res.json(items);
});

app.get('/items/search', (req, res) => {
    const query = req.query.name;
    const filteredItems = items.filter(item => item.name.includes(query));
    res.json(filteredItems);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

// Expected Output:
// Server is running on port 3000

// Use a tool like Postman to send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/items
// Expected Output: [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }]

// Use a tool like Postman to send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/items/search?name=Item 1
// Expected Output: [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }]
