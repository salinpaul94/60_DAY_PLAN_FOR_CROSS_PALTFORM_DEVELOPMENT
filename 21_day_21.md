import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const Greeting = (props) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{props.message}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
```
Output: Displays a greeting message passed as a prop.

For Using State in a Component:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

const ToggleGreeting = () => {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('Hello');

  const toggleGreeting = () => {
    setGreeting((prevGreeting) => (prevGreeting === 'Hello' ? 'Goodbye' : 'Hello'));
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{greeting}</Text>
      <Button title="Toggle Greeting" onPress={toggleGreeting} />

import React from 'react';
import { TextInput, Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Formik } from 'formik';
import * as Yup from 'yup';

const FormLibraryExample = () => {
  return (
    <Formik
      initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
      validationSchema={Yup.object({
        email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email address').required('Required'),
        password: Yup.string().min(8, 'Must be at least 8 characters').required('Required'),
      })}
      onSubmit={(values) => {
        console.log(values);
      }}
    >
      {({ handleChange, handleBlur, handleSubmit, values, errors, touched }) => (
        <View>
          <TextInput
            placeholder="Email"
            onChangeText={handleChange('email')}
            onBlur={handleBlur('email')}
            value={values.email}
          />
          {touched.email && errors.email && <Text>{errors.email}</Text>}
          <TextInput
            placeholder="Password"
            onChangeText={handleChange('password')}
            onBlur={handleBlur('password')}
            value={values.password}
            secureTextEntry
          />
          {touched.password && errors.password && <Text>{errors.password}</Text>}
          <Button onPress={handleSubmit} title="Submit" />
        </View>

### Task 20: Integrate a third-party library into your project

**Explanation:**
Integrating a third-party library into a React Native project involves installing the library, configuring it, and using its components or functions within the application. This process allows developers to leverage pre-built solutions to enhance the application's functionality and speed up development.

Integrating third-party libraries helps developers add new features and capabilities to their applications without having to build everything from scratch. It ensures that the application can benefit from community-driven enhancements and best practices.

**Resources:**
- [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/)
- [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)

**Example 1: Integrating a UI Library (React Native Elements)**
To integrate a UI library:
1. Install React Native Elements.
2. Import and use components from the library to build the UI.

**Example Explanation:**
Integrating a UI library like React Native Elements provides access to a set of customizable and ready-to-use UI components. This simplifies the process of building a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

**Example 2: Integrating a State Management Library (MobX)**
To integrate a state management library:
1. Install MobX and MobX React.
2. Use MobX to manage the application's state.

**Example Explanation:**
Integrating a state management library like MobX simplifies state management by providing tools for handling state and reactivity. This makes it easier to manage complex application state with minimal code.

**Resources:**
- [React Native Elements Documentation](https://reactnativeelements.com/)
- [MobX Documentation](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)

**Expected Output:**
For Integrating a UI Library:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Button, Card } from 'react-native-elements';

const UILibraryExample = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Card>
        <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
        <Card.Divider />
        <Text>Card content goes here</Text>
        <Button title="Press me" />
      </Card>
    </View>
  );
};

export default UILibraryExample;
```
Output: Uses React Native Elements components to create a card with a button.

For Integrating a State Management Library:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';
import { observable } from 'mobx';
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';

class CounterStore {
  @observable count = 0;

  increment = () => {
    this.count++;
  };
}

const store = new CounterStore();

const StateManagementExample = observer(() => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {store.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={store.increment} />
    </View>
  );
});

export default StateManagementExample;
```
Output: Uses MobX to manage the application's state, with observable state and reactive components.
