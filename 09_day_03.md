### Day 3 Study Plan: JavaScript Advanced Topics

#### Task 1: JavaScript ES6 Features
**Explanation:**
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features to JavaScript that enhance its capabilities and make coding more efficient. Key features include `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declarations, arrow functions for concise function syntax, template literals for string interpolation, and destructuring for extracting values from arrays and objects.

Understanding ES6 features is essential for modern JavaScript development, as they simplify the code and improve readability. These features also introduce new ways to handle asynchronous operations, such as Promises, and add syntactic sugar for classes, making object-oriented programming in JavaScript more accessible.

**Online Resources:**
1. [ES6 Features - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
2. [Introduction to ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp)

**Example 1: Let and Const**
1. **Let Declaration:** Use `let` to declare block-scoped variables.
2. **Const Declaration:** Use `const` to declare constants.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
`let` allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in which they are used, preventing issues with variable hoisting. `const` is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned, ensuring that their values remain constant throughout the program.

**Example 2: Arrow Functions**
1. **Basic Arrow Function:** Use an arrow function to write a simple function.
2. **Arrow Function with Parameters:** Use an arrow function with parameters and a concise body.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions, making the code cleaner and more concise. They also lexically bind the `this` value, which can simplify handling the `this` context in nested functions or callbacks.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Let and Const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
2. [Arrow Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Let and Const
let name = 'Alice';
const age = 30;
name = 'Bob';
// age = 25; // This will throw an error

console.log(name); // Expected Output: Bob
console.log(age); // Expected Output: 30
```

```js
// Arrow Functions
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Expected Output: 5
console.log(greet('Alice')); // Expected Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### Task 2: JavaScript Promises
**Explanation:**
Promises in JavaScript represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A Promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error). Promises simplify handling asynchronous code, avoiding the need for deeply nested callbacks (callback hell).

Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. The `then()` method is used to handle the fulfillment, while `catch()` handles any errors that occur. Understanding how to use Promises is essential for managing asynchronous operations effectively in JavaScript.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Promises - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
2. [JavaScript Promise Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp)

**Example 1: Creating and Using Promises**
1. **Creating a Promise:** Create a Promise that resolves after a delay.
2. **Using .then():** Use the `.then()` method to handle the resolved value.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Creating a Promise involves defining an executor function that takes `resolve` and `reject` as arguments. The `.then()` method allows you to specify what to do when the Promise is resolved, enabling you to chain asynchronous operations in a clean and readable way.

**Example 2: Handling Errors with .catch()**
1. **Rejecting a Promise:** Create a Promise that rejects with an error.
2. **Using .catch():** Use the `.catch()` method to handle the rejection.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Rejecting a Promise involves calling the `reject` function with an error message. The `.catch()` method allows you to specify what to do when the Promise is rejected, enabling you to handle errors gracefully in your asynchronous code.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Using Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
2. [JavaScript Promises Tutorial](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Creating and Using Promises
const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

delay(1000).then(() => console.log('Resolved after 1 second'));
// Expected Output: Resolved after 1 second (after 1 second delay)
```

```js
// Handling Errors with .catch()
const willReject = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Promise rejected!')), 1000);
});

willReject.then(() => console.log('This will not run'))
    .catch(error => console.error(error.message));
// Expected Output: Promise rejected! (after 1 second delay)
```

#### Task 3: JavaScript Async/Await
**Explanation:**
Async/Await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, introduced in ES8, making asynchronous code easier to write and read. The `async` keyword before a function declaration indicates that the function will return a Promise. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of an `async` function until the Promise is resolved, simplifying the chaining of asynchronous operations.

Using Async/Await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, avoiding the callback hell and improving readability. This is particularly useful when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that depend on each other.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Async/Await - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
2. [Async/Await Tutorial](https://javascript.info/async-await)

**Example 1: Basic Async/Await**
1. **Async Function:** Declare an async function that returns a resolved Promise.
2. **Awaiting a Promise:** Use `await` to wait for the Promise to resolve before continuing execution.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
The `async` keyword makes a function return a Promise, and `await` pauses the function execution until the Promise is resolved. This allows you to write asynchronous code in a more linear and readable fashion.

**Example 2: Handling Errors with Async/Await**
1. **Try/Catch Block:** Use a `try/catch` block to handle errors in an async function.
2. **Awaiting a Rejected Promise:** Handle a rejected Promise using a `try/catch` block.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Using a `try/catch` block within an async function allows you to handle errors gracefully. If the awaited Promise is rejected, the `catch` block will execute, enabling you to manage exceptions and continue execution.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Understanding Async/Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await)
2. [Async/Await in JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Basic Async/Await
async function fetchData() {
    return 'Data fetched';
}

async function displayData() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
}

displayData(); // Expected Output: Data fetched
```

```js
// Handling Errors with Async/Await
async function fetchWithError() {
    throw new Error('Fetch failed');
}

async function displayWithErrorHandling() {
    try {
        const data = await fetchWithError();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
}

displayWithErrorHandling(); // Expected Output: Fetch failed
```

#### Task 4: JavaScript Classes
**Explanation:**
JavaScript classes, introduced in ES6, provide a more intuitive syntax for creating objects and working with inheritance. A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. The `class` keyword is used to define a class, and the `constructor` method initializes the object's properties. Methods are defined within the class body, and inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword.

Classes in JavaScript enhance code organization and reuse, making it easier to implement object-oriented programming concepts. Understanding how to use classes and inheritance allows you to create modular, maintainable, and scalable code.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Classes - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
2. [JavaScript Classes Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp)

**Example 1: Creating a Class**
1. **Basic Class:** Define a class with a constructor and a method.
2. **Creating an Instance:** Create an instance of the class and call its method.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
A class definition includes a constructor method for initializing properties and other methods for defining behavior. Creating an

 instance of the class and calling its methods demonstrates how to use the class to create objects and interact with them.

**Example 2: Class Inheritance**
1. **Subclass:** Define a subclass that extends a base class.
2. **Overriding Methods:** Override a method in the subclass and call the superclass method.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Inheritance allows you to create a new class that extends the functionality of an existing class. The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor and methods of the superclass, enabling code reuse and polymorphism.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Class Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends)
2. [JavaScript Class Syntax](https://javascript.info/class)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Creating a Class
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}

const alice = new Person('Alice', 30);
alice.greet(); // Expected Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

```js
// Class Inheritance
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    makeSound() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        super.makeSound();
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.makeSound();
// Expected Output:
// Rex makes a sound.
// Rex barks.
```

#### Task 5: JavaScript Modules
**Explanation:**
JavaScript modules allow you to organize and reuse code by breaking it into separate files, each exporting specific functionalities. The `export` keyword is used to export functions, objects, or primitives from a module, and the `import` keyword is used to bring them into another module. Modules provide a way to manage dependencies and encapsulate code, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

Using modules, you can avoid polluting the global namespace and keep related code together. This makes it easier to manage large codebases and collaborate with other developers, as each module can be developed and tested independently.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Modules - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
2. [JavaScript ES6 Modules](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_modules.asp)

**Example 1: Exporting and Importing Modules**
1. **Exporting a Function:** Export a function from one module.
2. **Importing a Function:** Import and use the function in another module.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Exporting functions from a module allows them to be reused in other parts of the application. Importing these functions into other modules demonstrates how to share functionality across different files, promoting code reuse.

**Example 2: Named and Default Exports**
1. **Named Exports:** Use named exports to export multiple values from a module.
2. **Default Export:** Use default export to export a single value from a module.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Named exports allow you to export multiple values from a module, each identified by name. Default export allows you to export a single value from a module, which can be imported without specifying a name. This provides flexibility in how modules are structured and used.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Import/Export](https://javascript.info/import-export)
2. [Using JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Exporting and Importing Modules (file1.js)
export function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Importing and Using Modules (file2.js)
import { greet } from './file1.js';

console.log(greet('Alice')); // Expected Output: Hello, Alice!
```

```js
// Named and Default Exports (file3.js)
export const name = 'Alice';
export const age = 30;

const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 30
};
export default person;

// Importing Named and Default Exports (file4.js)
import person, { name, age } from './file3.js';

console.log(name); // Expected Output: Alice
console.log(age); // Expected Output: 30
console.log(person); // Expected Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
```

#### Task 6: JavaScript Error Handling
**Explanation:**
Error handling in JavaScript involves using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions and ensure that code can gracefully recover from errors. The `try` block contains code that might throw an error, while the `catch` block handles the error if it occurs. The `finally` block contains code that will always execute, regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.

Proper error handling is crucial for building robust and reliable applications. By catching and handling errors, you can prevent the application from crashing and provide meaningful feedback to the user or take corrective actions.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Error Handling - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling)
2. [JavaScript Try Catch Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp)

**Example 1: Basic Error Handling**
1. **Try/Catch Block:** Use a `try/catch` block to handle errors in code.
2. **Throwing an Error:** Explicitly throw an error within the `try` block.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
The `try/catch` block allows you to catch and handle errors that occur in the `try` block. Throwing an error explicitly demonstrates how to create and handle custom errors, providing more control over error management.

**Example 2: Finally Block**
1. **Using Finally:** Add a `finally` block to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred.
2. **Cleaning Up Resources:** Use the `finally` block to clean up resources, such as closing files or network connections.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
The `finally` block ensures that certain code will always run, regardless of whether an error occurred. This is useful for cleaning up resources or performing any final actions that must be executed, ensuring the program's stability and reliability.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Try/Catch/Finally](https://javascript.info/try-catch)
2. [Error Handling in JavaScript](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/javascript-error-handling.php)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Basic Error Handling
try {
    let result = 10 / 0;
    if (!isFinite(result)) {
        throw new Error('Division by zero');
    }
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
}
// Expected Output: Division by zero
```

```js
// Finally Block
try {
    let result = 10 / 0;
    if (!isFinite(result)) {
        throw new Error('Division by zero');
    }
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
} finally {
    console.log('Execution completed');
}
// Expected Output:
// Division by zero
// Execution completed
```

#### Task 7: JavaScript DOM Manipulation
**Explanation:**
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the HTML. DOM manipulation involves selecting elements, changing their content, and modifying their styles.

Understanding how to manipulate the DOM is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Common methods for DOM manipulation include `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `innerHTML`, and `style`. These methods allow you to update the content and appearance of web pages in response to user interactions or other events.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript DOM Manipulation - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
2. [JavaScript HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

**Example 1: Selecting and Modifying Elements**
1. **Selecting an Element:** Use `document.getElementById` to select an element by its ID.
2. **Modifying Content:** Use `innerHTML` to change the content of the selected element.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Selecting an element by its ID allows you to target specific elements on the web page. Changing the content of an element using `innerHTML` allows you to dynamically update the page's content based on user interactions or other events.

**Example 2: Changing Styles**
1. **Modifying Styles:** Use the `style` property to change the CSS styles of an element.
2. **Adding and Removing Classes:** Use `classList` to add or remove CSS classes.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Modifying styles directly allows you to change the appearance of elements dynamically. Using `classList` to add or remove CSS classes provides a flexible way to apply predefined styles based on user interactions or other conditions.

        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
**Expected Output:** A webpage with a paragraph and a button. Clicking the button changes the paragraph's style to red and bold.

#### Task 8: JavaScript Events
**Explanation:**
Events in JavaScript are actions that occur in the browser, such as clicks, key presses, or mouse movements. Event handling involves writing code that executes in response to these events. Event listeners are used to listen for specific events on elements and execute a callback function when the event occurs.

Understanding events and how to handle them is crucial for creating interactive web applications. Common events include `click`, `mouseover`, `keydown`, and `submit`. By handling these events, you can make your web pages more responsive and user-friendly.

1. [JavaScript Events - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp)
2. [MDN Web Docs - Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

**Example 1: Click Event**
1. **Adding an Event Listener:** Use `addEventListener` to listen for a click event on a button.
2. **Callback Function:** Define a callback function to execute when the button is clicked.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Adding an event listener to a button allows you to execute code when the button is clicked. The callback function defines what happens when the event occurs, such as changing the content of an element or displaying an alert.

**Example 2: Mouseover Event**
1. **Mouseover Listener:** Use `addEventListener` to listen for a mouseover event on an element.
2. **Changing Styles:** Change the styles of the element when the mouseover event occurs.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
A mouseover event occurs when the user moves the mouse pointer over an element. By handling this event, you can change the element's styles, such as highlighting it or displaying additional information, enhancing the user experience.

**Online Resources:**

        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
**Expected Output:** A webpage with a paragraph. Moving the mouse over the paragraph changes its style to red and bold.

#### Task 9: JavaScript Timers
**Explanation:**
JavaScript timers allow you to execute code at specified intervals or after a certain delay. The `setTimeout` function executes code after a specified delay, while `setInterval` repeatedly executes code at specified intervals. Timers are useful for creating animations, updating content periodically, or delaying code execution.

Understanding how to use `setTimeout` and `setInterval` is essential for managing timed events in JavaScript. These functions enable you to create dynamic and interactive web applications that respond to time-based events.

**Online Resources:**

**Example 1: Using setTimeout**
1. **Delay Execution:** Use `setTimeout` to execute code after a delay.
2. **Clearing Timeout:** Use `clearTimeout` to cancel a timeout before it executes.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
The `setTimeout` function allows you to delay code execution, which can be useful for creating animations or showing messages after a delay. The `clearTimeout` function cancels a timeout, preventing the code from executing if certain conditions are met.

**Example 2: Using setInterval**
1. **Periodic Execution:** Use `setInterval` to execute code at regular intervals.
2. **Clearing Interval:** Use `clearInterval` to stop the interval execution.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
The `setInterval` function repeatedly executes code at specified intervals, which can be useful for updating content periodically or creating repeated animations. The `clearInterval` function stops the interval execution, preventing the code from running further.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript setTimeout](https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval)
2. [JavaScript setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Using setTimeout
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Executed after 2 seconds');
}, 2000);

// Clearing Timeout
clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Expected Output: Nothing, as the timeout is cleared
```

```js
// Using setInterval
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Executed every 1 second');
}, 1000);

// Clearing Interval
setTimeout(() => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    console.log('Interval cleared');
}, 5000);
// Expected Output:
// Executed every 1 second (repeats 4 times)
// Interval cleared (after 5 seconds)
```

#### Task 10: JavaScript Closures
**Explanation:**
Closures in JavaScript are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function has returned. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function retains access to the variables of the outer function. Closures are a powerful feature that enable functions to have private variables and persistent state.

Closures are used in various scenarios, such as data encapsulation, function factories, and callback functions. Understanding closures is essential for mastering JavaScript, as they form the foundation of many advanced programming techniques.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JavaScript Closures - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
2. [Understanding JavaScript Closures](https://javascript.info/closure)

**Example 1: Basic Closure**
1. **Creating a Closure:** Define a function inside another function and access the outer functionâ€™s variables.
2. **Persistent State:** Demonstrate how closures maintain state across function calls.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
A closure allows the inner function to access and retain the variables of the outer function, even after the outer function has executed. This enables the inner function to maintain state and create private variables that are not accessible from outside.

**Example 2: Function Factory**
1. **Creating Functions Dynamically:** Use closures to create functions dynamically with different behaviors.
2. **Customizing Functions:** Demonstrate how closures can customize functions based on different parameters.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Function factories use closures to create multiple functions with different behaviors based on parameters passed to the outer function. This technique allows for dynamic function creation and customization, providing flexibility and reusability.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Closures Tutorial

2. [JavaScript Closure Examples](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-closures-in-javascript)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```js
// Basic Closure
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am an outer variable';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Expected Output: I am an outer variable
```

```js
// Function Factory
function createGreeting(greeting) {
    return function(name) {
        console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
    };
}

const sayHello = createGreeting('Hello');
const sayHi = createGreeting('Hi');

sayHello('Alice'); // Expected Output: Hello, Alice!
sayHi('Bob'); // Expected Output: Hi, Bob!
```

#### Task 11: JavaScript Higher-Order Functions
**Explanation:**
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. Higher-order functions enable functional programming techniques, allowing you to write more modular, reusable, and concise code.

Common examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript include `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These functions operate on arrays, transforming, filtering, or reducing their elements based on a provided callback function. Understanding higher-order functions is essential for writing functional and declarative JavaScript code.

#### Task 12: JavaScript Prototypes and Inheritance
**Explanation:**
Prototypes are a fundamental feature in JavaScript, providing a mechanism for inheritance. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object that provides shared properties and methods. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself, and if not found, it searches the object's prototype chain.

Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This provides a flexible and efficient way to share functionality and create object hierarchies. Understanding prototypes and inheritance is essential for mastering JavaScript's object-oriented programming capabilities.

#### Task 13: JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming
**Explanation:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript involves organizing code into objects, each containing properties and methods that define their behavior. OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism help create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. JavaScript supports OOP through its prototypal inheritance and ES6 class syntax.

Encapsulation involves bundling data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, enabling code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility in code design.
