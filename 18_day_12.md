### Day 12 Study Plan: Advanced Topics in Full-Stack Development

#### Task 1: Introduction to Serverless Computing
**Explanation:**
Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than pre-purchased units of capacity. This model allows developers to focus on code without worrying about infrastructure, providing an efficient way to build and deploy applications.

Using serverless computing involves creating functions, setting up triggers, and deploying the functions to a cloud provider like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. This approach ensures that your application can scale automatically, handle concurrent executions, and provide cost-effective resource management.

**Online Resources:**
1. [AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
2. [Serverless Framework Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/)

**Example 1: Creating an AWS Lambda Function**
1. **Setting Up AWS Lambda:** Create a Lambda function using the AWS Management Console.
2. **Configuring a Trigger:** Set up an API Gateway trigger to invoke the Lambda function.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Setting up AWS Lambda involves creating a function in the AWS Management Console, specifying the runtime environment, and writing the function code. Configuring a trigger involves setting up an API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function based on HTTP requests, enabling serverless API endpoints.

**Example 2: Using Serverless Framework**
1. **Installing Serverless Framework:** Use the Serverless Framework CLI to create and deploy serverless functions.
2. **Deploying a Function:** Define and deploy a serverless function using the Serverless Framework configuration file.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Installing the Serverless Framework provides tools to manage serverless functions across different cloud providers. Deploying a function involves defining the function and its triggers in a configuration file and using the Serverless Framework CLI to deploy the function to the cloud, simplifying the serverless deployment process.

    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: 'Hello, Serverless Framework!',
    }),
  };
};

# Deploy the function:
serverless deploy

# Expected Output: A serverless function is defined and deployed using the Serverless Framework, accessible via an API Gateway endpoint.
```

#### Task 2: Introduction to GraphQL Subscriptions
**Explanation:**
GraphQL subscriptions are a mechanism to allow clients to receive real-time updates from the server. They use WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection, enabling the server to push updates to the client as events occur. This is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time data, such as live chat, notifications, or live sports scores.

Using GraphQL subscriptions involves defining subscription operations in the GraphQL schema and implementing resolvers to handle the subscription logic. This approach ensures that clients can receive real-time updates, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

# server.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { PubSub } = require('graphql-subscriptions');
const pubsub = new PubSub();

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
  type Subscription {
    messageSent: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, world!'
  },
  Subscription: {
    messageSent: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator('MESSAGE_SENT')
    }
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  subscriptions: {
    path: '/subscriptions'
  }
});

server.listen().then(({ url, subscriptionsUrl }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ${subscriptionsUrl}`);
});

# Expected Output: Apollo Server is set up with subscriptions, allowing clients to subscribe to real-time updates.
```

```js
# Implementing a Subscription in Apollo Client

import React from 'react';
import { useSubscription, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const MESSAGE_SENT = gql`
  subscription {
    messageSent
  }
`;

const Messages = () => {
  const { data, loading } = useSubscription(MESSAGE_SENT);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return <div>{data.messageSent}</div>;
};

export default Messages;

# Expected Output: Apollo Client is configured for subscriptions, and the Messages component updates in real-time when new messages are sent.
```

#### Task 3: Implementing GraphQL Federated Services
**Explanation:**
GraphQL federation is a technique that allows you to compose multiple GraphQL services into a single unified API. It enables you to split your schema across multiple services and then stitch them together, providing a scalable and modular approach to GraphQL architecture. This is particularly useful for large applications with multiple teams, allowing each team to manage their own GraphQL services independently.

Using GraphQL federation involves setting up federated services and a gateway to combine these services. This approach ensures that your application can scale efficiently, providing a unified API while allowing teams to work independently.

    console.log('Sent:', msg);
  });
});

# Expected Output: The Product service receives messages from the User service using RabbitMQ, enabling inter-service communication via message brokering.
```

#### Task 5: Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing
**Explanation:**
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern that separates read and write operations into different models. This separation allows for more efficient querying and better scalability. Event Sourcing is a pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events, rather than as a direct update to the data store. This provides a complete history of changes, enabling better auditing and rollback capabilities.

Using CQRS and Event Sourcing involves defining separate models for reading and writing data and implementing event storage to capture all state changes. This approach ensures that your application can handle complex scenarios efficiently, providing better performance and scalability.

**Online Resources:**

martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)

**Example 1: Implementing CQRS**
1. **Defining Read and Write Models:** Separate the read and write models in your application to handle different types of operations.
2. **Implementing Command Handlers:** Implement command handlers to process write operations and update the data store.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Defining read and write models involves creating separate models to handle reading and writing data, ensuring that each model is optimized for its specific purpose. Implementing command handlers involves writing functions to process commands (write operations) and update the data store, providing a clear separation of responsibilities.

**Example 2: Implementing Event Sourcing**
1. **Storing Events:** Implement logic to store events representing state changes in an event store.
2. **Replaying Events:** Implement logic to replay events to reconstruct the current state of the application.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Storing events involves capturing state changes as events and storing them in an event store, ensuring that all changes are recorded. Replaying events involves reading the stored events and applying them to reconstruct the current state, enabling accurate and up-to-date state management.

```js
# Implementing CQRS
# Define read and write models:
const readModel = {
  getProducts: () => {
    // Logic to fetch products from the database
  }
};

const writeModel = {
  addProduct: (product) => {
    // Logic to add a product to the database
  }
};

# Implementing command handlers:
const commandHandlers = {
  handleAddProduct: (product) => {
    // Validate and process the command
    writeModel.addProduct(product);
  }
};

# Expected Output: Read and write models are separated, with command handlers processing write operations.
```

```js
# Implementing Event Sourcing
# Install a library for event storage:
npm install eventstore

# Storing events:
const eventStore = require('eventstore')();

const storeEvent = (event) => {
  eventStore.emit(event.type, event);
};

storeEvent({ type: 'productAdded', data: { id: 1, name: 'Table' } });

# Replaying events:
const replayEvents = () => {
  eventStore.on('productAdded', (event) => {
    // Apply the event to reconstruct state
    console.log('Replaying event:', event);
  });

  eventStore.events.forEach((event) => {
    eventStore.emit(event.type, event);
  });
};

replayEvents();

# Expected Output: Events are stored and replayed to reconstruct the current state, enabling event sourcing.
```

#### Task 6: Implementing Authentication with Passport.js
