### Task 1: Review deployment strategies for mobile apps

**Explanation:**
Deployment strategies for mobile apps involve the processes and methodologies used to deliver applications to users' devices. This includes choosing the right tools and platforms for building, testing, and distributing the app. Common strategies include using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, beta testing programs, and app stores for distribution. Effective deployment strategies ensure a smooth and efficient process for releasing updates and new versions of the app.

Deployment strategies are crucial for ensuring that the application reaches users reliably and efficiently. They help automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and provide a consistent process for delivering high-quality updates to users.
