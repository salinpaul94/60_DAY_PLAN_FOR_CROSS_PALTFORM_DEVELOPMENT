```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('ErrorBoundary caught an error', error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;

import axios from 'axios';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
        setData(response.data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return data ? <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
};

export default DataFetcher;
```

  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to implement an error boundary in React Native. The `ErrorBoundary` component catches errors in the component tree and displays a fallback UI, preventing the application from crashing.

**Example 2: Using Error Boundary in App**

### Task 13: Study continuous deployment (CD)

**Explanation:**
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically deployed to production after passing automated tests. CD aims to make releases more reliable and faster, reducing the time it takes to deliver new features and bug fixes to users. CD tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins automate the process of deploying code changes to production environments.

Studying continuous deployment is essential for maintaining a high-quality release process and ensuring that code changes are deployed quickly and reliably. It helps developers deliver new features and bug fixes to users faster, improving the overall development workflow and user experience.

### Task 15: Study automated testing

**Explanation:**
Automated testing involves using software tools to run tests on an application automatically. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Automated testing helps ensure that code changes do not introduce new bugs, improve code quality, and accelerate the development process. Tools like Jest, Mocha, and Cypress are commonly used for automated testing in JavaScript applications.

Studying automated testing is essential for maintaining a high-quality codebase and efficient development workflow. It helps developers catch and fix bugs early, improve code reliability, and ensure that new features and changes do not break existing functionality.

**Resources:**
- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [Automated Testing: What It Is and Why It Matters](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-automated-testing)

**Example 1: Writing Unit Tests with Jest**
```javascript
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;

// sum.test.js
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to write a basic unit test with Jest. The `sum` function is tested to ensure that it correctly adds two numbers.

**Example 2: Writing Integration Tests with Jest**
```javascript
// fetchData.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchData(url) {
  const response = await axios.get(url);
  return response.data;
}
module.exports = fetchData;

// fetchData.test.js
const fetchData = require('./fetchData');
jest.mock('axios');

test('fetches data from API', async () => {
  const data = { name: 'John Doe' };
  axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data });

  const result = await fetchData('https://api.example.com/user');
  expect(result).toEqual(data);
});
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to write an integration test with Jest. The `fetchData` function is tested to ensure that it correctly fetches data from an API, using Jest to mock the `axios` library.

### Task 17: Study end-to-end testing

**Explanation:**
End-to-end (E2E) testing involves testing an application from start to finish to ensure that it behaves as expected in a real-world scenario. E2E tests simulate user interactions with the application, such as navigating through pages, filling out forms, and submitting data. Tools like Cypress, Selenium, and Detox are commonly used for E2E testing in web and mobile applications.

Studying end-to-end testing is essential for ensuring that an application works correctly and provides a seamless user experience. It helps developers identify and fix issues that may arise from the interaction of different components and functionalities.

**Resources:**
- [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress)
- [Introduction to End-to-End Testing](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/introduction-to-end-to-end-testing)

**Example 1: Writing E2E Tests with Cypress**
```javascript
// Install Cypress
npm install --save-dev cypress

// Open Cypress Test Runner
npx cypress open

// Write an E2E test
// cypress/integration/sample_spec.js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
    cy.contains('type').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions');
    cy.get('.action-email').type('email@example.com').should('have.value', 'email@example.com');
  });
});
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to write an E2E test with Cypress. The test visits a website, clicks a button, checks the URL, and types into an input field, verifying that the value was entered correctly.

**Example 2: Writing E2E Tests with Detox for React Native**
```javascript
// Install Detox and dependencies
npm install --save-dev detox
detox init -r jest

// Write an E2E test
// e2e/firstTest.spec.js
describe('Example', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
  });

  it('should have welcome screen', async () => {
    await expect(element(by.id('welcome'))).toBeVisible();
  });

  it('should show hello screen after tap', async () => {
    await element(by.id('hello_button')).tap();
    await expect(element(by.text('Hello!!!'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

**Example Explanation:**

### Task 19: Study snapshot testing

**Explanation:**
Snapshot testing involves capturing the rendered output of a component and comparing it to a previously stored snapshot. If the output changes, the test fails, indicating that the component's behavior has changed. Snapshot testing is commonly used in React applications to ensure that components render correctly and maintain their expected output over time. Jest provides built-in support for snapshot testing.

Studying snapshot testing is essential for maintaining the visual and functional consistency of components in an application. It helps developers detect unintended changes and ensure that components render as expected.

**Resources:**
- [Jest Snapshot Testing Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing)
- [Introduction to Snapshot Testing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/snapshot-testing-react-components-jest/)

**Example 1: Writing Snapshot Tests with Jest**
```javascript
// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ name }) => <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;

export default MyComponent;

// MyComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent name="John" />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to write a snapshot test with Jest. The `MyComponent` component is rendered, and its output is captured and compared to a previously stored snapshot to ensure it renders correctly.

**Example 2: Updating Snapshots with Jest**
```bash
# Run Jest tests and update snapshots
jest --updateSnapshot
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example demonstrates how to update snapshots with Jest. If the component's output changes and the changes are intentional, developers can update the stored snapshots to reflect the new output.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: Snapshot Testing](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_snapshot_testing.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Snapshot Testing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-snapshot-testing/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
