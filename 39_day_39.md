```
```ts
// Define types for state and actions
interface State {
  count: number;
}

interface IncrementAction {
  type: 'increment';
}

interface DecrementAction {
  type: 'decrement';
}

type Action = IncrementAction | DecrementAction;

// Reducer function with type annotations
function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

// App.tsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const initialState: State = { count: 0 };

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {state.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })} />
      <Button title="Decrement" onPress={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Output: Implements type-safe state management with TypeScript by defining types for state and actions, and using those types with the useReducer hook.

### Implement Real-Time Updates with WebSockets

**Explanation:**
WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP, where a client requests data from the server and the server responds, WebSockets allow the server to send updates to the client without the client explicitly requesting it. This makes WebSockets ideal for real-time applications where updates need to be sent to clients as soon as they occur, such as chat applications, live sports scores, and collaborative tools.

Using WebSockets in a React Native application involves setting up a WebSocket server to handle connections and send messages, and creating WebSocket clients in the application to connect to the server and handle incoming messages. This setup ensures that all clients are kept up-to-date with the latest information in real-time, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

### Example 1: Setting Up a WebSocket Server

**Explanation:**
Setting up a WebSocket server involves using a WebSocket library, such as the `ws` library for Node.js, to create a server that can accept WebSocket connections, handle incoming messages, and broadcast messages to all connected clients. This example demonstrates how to set up a basic WebSocket server using the `ws` library.

The server listens for incoming connections and messages, and broadcasts any received messages to all connected clients. This ensures that all clients receive real-time updates whenever a message is sent by any client.

**Example Code:**
```sh
# Install the ws library
npm install ws

# server.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });

  ws.send('Welcome to the WebSocket server!');
});

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
# The server starts and listens for WebSocket connections on port 8080.
# When a client connects, the server sends a welcome message.
# When a client sends a message, it is broadcasted to all connected clients.
```

### Example 2: Creating a WebSocket Client in React Native

**Explanation:**
Creating a WebSocket client in React Native involves using the built-in WebSocket API to connect to the WebSocket server, send messages, and handle incoming messages. This example demonstrates how to set up a basic WebSocket client in a React Native application that connects to the server, sends messages, and updates the UI with received messages.

The client establishes a connection to the server, sends messages typed by the user, and displays any messages received from the server in real-time. This provides a real-time chat-like experience within the React Native application.

**Example Code:**
```js
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, event.data]);
    };

    return () => {
      socket.close();
    };
  }, [socket]);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.send(input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>Real-Time Chat with WebSockets</Text>
      <View style={styles.messages}>
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <Text key={index} style={styles.message}>{msg}</Text>
        ))}
      </View>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={input}
        onChangeText={setInput}
        placeholder="Enter a message"
      />
      <Button title="Send" onPress={sendMessage} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
  },
  header: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  messages: {
    flex: 1,
    marginVertical: 10,
  },
  message: {
    fontSize: 16,
    marginVertical: 2,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
});

export default App;
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
# The React Native application connects to the WebSocket server on ws://localhost:8080.
# Users can type messages into the input field and send them.
# Sent messages are displayed in the message list in real-time.
# Messages from other clients are also displayed in real-time.
