### Day 14 Study Plan: Advanced Full-Stack Development Topics

#### Task 1: Implementing Serverless Functions with AWS Lambda
**Explanation:**
Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications without managing infrastructure. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. It enables you to execute code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

Using AWS Lambda involves creating functions that are triggered by events such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table, or an HTTP request via Amazon API Gateway. This approach ensures that your application is highly scalable and cost-effective, as you only pay for the compute time you consume.

**Online Resources:**
1. [AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
2. [Serverless Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)

**Example 1: Creating an AWS Lambda Function**
1. **Setting Up Lambda Function:** Use the AWS Management Console to create a new Lambda function.
2. **Triggering Lambda Function:** Configure an event source to trigger the Lambda function.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Setting up a Lambda function involves creating a new function in the AWS Management Console and defining the runtime and handler. Configuring an event source involves setting up a trigger, such as an S3 event or an API Gateway request, to invoke the Lambda function automatically.

**Example 2: Deploying Lambda Function Using AWS CLI**
1. **Writing Lambda Function Code:** Write the code for the Lambda function in your preferred language.
2. **Deploying with AWS CLI:** Use the AWS CLI to package and deploy the Lambda function.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Writing the Lambda function code involves creating the function in a supported language (e.g., Node.js, Python). Deploying with AWS CLI involves packaging the function code into a ZIP file and using the `aws lambda` CLI commands to deploy the function to AWS.

**Online Resources:**
1. [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/index.html)
2. [Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)

```python
# Example 1: Creating an AWS Lambda Function
# lambda_function.py
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello, Lambda!'
    }

# Expected Output: A Lambda function that returns "Hello, Lambda!" when triggered.
```

```sh
# Example 2: Deploying Lambda Function Using AWS CLI
# Package the function code:
zip function.zip lambda_function.py

# Deploy the function using AWS CLI:
aws lambda create-function --function-name MyFunction --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler --runtime python3.8 --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/execution_role

# Expected Output: The Lambda function is deployed and can be invoked using the AWS CLI or configured triggers.
```

#### Task 2: Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
**Explanation:**
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Terraform is an open-source IaC tool that allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

Using Terraform involves writing configuration files to define the desired state of your infrastructure and using the Terraform CLI to apply these configurations. This approach ensures that your infrastructure is consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled, providing a robust and scalable way to manage infrastructure.

import store from './store';

const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
    <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
    decrement: () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
});

const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

const App = () => (
    <Provider store={store}>
        <ConnectedCounter />
