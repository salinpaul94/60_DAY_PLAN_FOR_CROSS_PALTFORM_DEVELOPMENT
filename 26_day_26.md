### Task 20: Implement multi-factor authentication

**Explanation:**
Multi-factor authentication (M

FA) adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. This typically includes something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile device or hardware token), and something the user is (biometric data). Implementing MFA involves integrating additional verification methods, such as SMS-based codes, authentication apps, or hardware tokens, into the authentication flow.

Implementing multi-factor authentication is essential for enhancing the security of an application. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring additional verification factors beyond just a password.

**Resources:**
- [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa)
- [Implementing Two-Factor Authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api)

**Example 1: Implementing SMS-Based MFA**
To implement SMS-based MFA:
1. Integrate with an SMS provider to send verification codes to the user's mobile device.
2. Implement server-side logic to verify the code and complete the authentication process.

**Example Explanation:**
Implementing SMS-based MFA involves integrating with an SMS provider to send verification codes and implementing server-side logic to verify the code. This adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process.

**Example 2: Implementing TOTP-Based MFA**
To implement TOTP-based MFA:
1. Use a library like speakeasy to generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
2. Implement server-side logic to verify the TOTP and complete the authentication process.

**Example Explanation:**
Implementing TOTP-based MFA involves using a library to generate time-based one-time passwords and implementing server-side logic to verify the TOTP. This provides a secure and user-friendly method for multi-factor authentication.

**Resources:**
- [SMS-Based MFA with Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api)
- [TOTP-Based MFA with Speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy)

**Expected Output:**
For Implementing SMS-Based MFA:
```sh
# Example implementation using Node.js and Twilio
npm install express twilio
```
```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const twilio = require('twilio');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const twilioClient = twilio('YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID', 'YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN');

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/send-code', (req, res) => {
  const { phoneNumber } = req.body;
  twilioClient.verify.services('YOUR_TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID')
    .verifications
    .create({ to: phoneNumber, channel: 'sms' })
    .then(verification => res.status(200).send({ sid: verification.sid }))
    .catch(error => res.status(500).send({ error: error.message }));
});

app.post('/verify-code', (req, res) => {
  const { phoneNumber, code } = req.body;
  twilioClient.verify.services('YOUR_TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID')
    .verificationChecks
    .create({ to: phoneNumber, code })
    .then(verification_check => {
      if (verification_check.status === 'approved') {
        res.status(200).send({ message: 'Verification successful' });
      } else {
        res.status(401).send({ message: 'Invalid code' });
      }
    })
    .catch(error => res.status(500).send({ error: error.message }));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MFA server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
Output: Implements SMS-based multi-factor authentication using Node.js and Twilio, with endpoints to send and verify SMS codes.

For Implementing TOTP-Based MFA:
```sh
# Example implementation using Node.js and Speakeasy
npm install express speakeasy
```
```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const speakeasy = require('speakeasy');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

const users = {}; // Store users and their TOTP secrets

app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  const secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({ length: 20 });
  users[email] = { secret: secret.base32 };
  res.status(201).send({ secret: secret.otpauth_url });
});

app.post('/verify', (req, res) => {
  const { email, token } = req.body;
  const user = users[email];
  if (user) {
    const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({
      secret: user.secret,
      encoding: 'base32',
      token,
      window: 1,
    });
    if (verified) {
      res.status(200).send({ message: 'Verification successful' });
    } else {
      res.status(401).send({ message: 'Invalid token' });
    }
  } else {
    res.status(404).send({ message: 'User not found' });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MFA server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
Output: Implements TOTP-based multi-factor authentication using Node.js and Speakeasy, with endpoints to register and verify TOTP tokens.
