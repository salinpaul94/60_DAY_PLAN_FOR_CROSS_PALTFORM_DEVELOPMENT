### Task 16: Implement multi-factor authentication

**Explanation:**
Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) involves adding an extra layer of security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors. These factors typically include something the user knows (password), something the user has (mobile device or hardware token), and something the user is (biometric data). MFA enhances security by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.

Implementing multi-factor authentication is essential for improving the security of an application. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access and protects user data by requiring additional verification factors.

**Resources:**
