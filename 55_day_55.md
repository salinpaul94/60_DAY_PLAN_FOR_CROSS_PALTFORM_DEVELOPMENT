1. **Designing a User Profile Page**

**Explanation:**
Designing a user profile page involves creating a layout that displays user information in a clean and organized manner. It requires the use of components such as images, text, and buttons, along with considerations for navigation and interactivity. The profile page should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, providing users with all the necessary information at a glance.

In a React Native app, this can be achieved using components like `View`, `Text`, and `Image`. The layout should be responsive to accommodate different screen sizes, and the design should follow UI/UX best practices such as consistent spacing, font sizes, and color schemes. Adding features like an edit button or a settings menu can enhance the user experience by providing easy access to additional functionalities.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Image, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';

const UserProfile = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/profile-pic' }} style={styles.profilePic} />
      <Text style={styles.name}>John Doe</Text>
      <Text style={styles.email}>johndoe@example.com</Text>
      <Button title="Edit Profile" onPress={() => { /* handle edit */ }} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  profilePic: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    borderRadius: 50,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  name: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  email: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'gray',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

2. **Implementing a Dark Mode Toggle**

**Explanation:**
Dark mode has become a popular feature in modern apps due to its ability to reduce eye strain and save battery life. Implementing a dark mode toggle in your React Native app allows users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences. This involves creating a theme management system and applying conditional styling based on the selected theme.

To implement dark mode, you need to define separate styles for light and dark themes and manage the theme state using React's state management. You can use context or state management libraries like Redux to handle the theme selection and ensure the entire app reflects the chosen theme. This practice not only enhances the user experience but also demonstrates your ability to implement advanced UI features.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Switch } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);

  const toggleSwitch = () => setDarkMode(previousState => !previousState);

  return (
    <View style={darkMode ? styles.darkContainer : styles.lightContainer}>
      <Text style={darkMode ? styles.darkText : styles.lightText}>
        Dark Mode is {darkMode ? 'On' : 'Off'}
      </Text>
      <Switch
        onValueChange={toggleSwitch}
        value={darkMode}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  lightContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  darkContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#333',
  },
  lightText: {
    color: '#000',
  },
  darkText: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
A simple application with a text indicating the current theme (light or dark) and a switch to toggle between the two themes.

3. **Creating a Responsive Grid Layout**

**Explanation:**
Responsive design ensures that your app looks good on all screen sizes, from small mobile devices to large tablets. A grid layout helps organize content in a structured manner, making it easier for users to navigate and find information. Implementing a responsive grid layout in React Native involves using Flexbox for flexible and adaptive layouts.

By using Flexbox, you can create a grid that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size. This requires understanding Flexbox properties like `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`. Additionally, using media queries with libraries like `react-native-responsive-screen` can help fine-tune the layout for different screen dimensions.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width } = Dimensions.get('window');
const numColumns = width > 600 ? 3 : 2;

const data = Array.from({ length: 12 }).map((_, i) => `Item ${i + 1}`);

const ResponsiveGrid = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <View key={index} style={styles.item}>
          <Text style={styles.text}>{item}</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  item: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    height: 100,
    width: (width - 20) / numColumns - 10,
    margin: 5,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});

export default ResponsiveGrid;
```

**Expected Output:**

### Task 2: Implement Responsive and Adaptive UI

#### Explanation

**Understanding Responsive and Adaptive UI**

Responsive UI design ensures that an application looks good and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. In React Native, this involves using flexible layouts and media queries to adjust the user interface dynamically based on the device's dimensions. Flexbox is a powerful tool in React Native for creating responsive layouts, allowing elements to grow, shrink, and wrap as needed to fit different screen sizes. By implementing responsive design, developers can create a seamless user experience across a range of devices, from small smartphones to large tablets.

Adaptive UI design goes a step further by not only adjusting the layout but also altering the UI elements and functionality based on the device or platform. This might include changing the placement of navigation elements, using different input methods, or optimizing for performance on different platforms.

### Task 3: Study Internationalization Best Practices

#### Explanation

**Understanding Internationalization (i18n) Best Practices**

Internationalization (i18n) involves designing and developing applications that can be easily adapted to different languages and regions without requiring engineering changes. It is crucial for creating applications that can cater to a global audience. Best practices in internationalization include using locale-specific formatting for dates, times, numbers, and currencies, as well as supporting different text directions (e.g., left-to-right for English and right-to-left for Arabic). Implementing internationalization early in the development process can save time and effort, ensuring that your application is accessible and user-friendly for people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

Another key aspect of internationalization is resource management. Instead of hardcoding strings and other locale-specific data directly in your application, use external resource files that can be easily translated and managed. This approach allows for the separation of the application's logic from its content, making it easier to update and maintain. Additionally, consider using libraries and frameworks that support internationalization to streamline the process and ensure consistency across your application.

Managing locale-specific resources involves organizing and storing translations and other locale-specific data in a structured manner. This practice ensures that your application can easily support multiple languages and regions. By using separate JSON files for each language, you can keep your translations organized and maintainable. 

In this example, you will learn how to create and manage locale-specific resource files for your React Native application. The goal is to set up a folder structure for different languages and load the appropriate translations based on the user's selected language. This approach helps in maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Create the translation files in the public/locales folder
// public/locales/en/translation.json
{
  "welcome": "Welcome"
}
// public/locales/es/translation.json
{
  "welcome": "Bienvenido"
}

// Update the i18next initialization to load the translations from the correct path
i18n
  .use(HttpBackend)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: true,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',

3. **Implementing Right-to-Left (RTL) Support**

**Explanation:**
Supporting right-to-left (RTL) languages is an essential aspect of internationalization, ensuring that your application is accessible to users who read and write in RTL languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. Implementing RTL support involves adjusting the layout and text direction to align with the RTL reading order.

In this example, you will learn how to implement RTL support in a React Native application. The goal is to detect the user's language direction and apply the appropriate layout adjustments. This practice helps in creating an inclusive application that caters to a diverse user base.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, I18nManager } from 'react-native';
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { useTranslation, initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import HttpBackend from 'i18next-http-backend';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

// Initialize i18next
i18n
  .use(HttpBackend)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: true,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',
    },
  });

const App = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();

  useEffect(() => {
    const isRTL = i18n.dir() === 'rtl';
    I18nManager.forceRTL(isRTL);
  }, [i18n.language]);

  const changeLanguage = (lng) => {
    i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>{t('welcome')}</Text>
      <Button title="English" onPress={() => changeLanguage('en')} />
      <Button title="Arabic" onPress={() => changeLanguage('ar')} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;

Implementing dynamic language switching involves using the `changeLanguage` method provided by `i18next` and updating the UI accordingly.

In this example, you will extend the basic setup to include dynamic language switching. By adding buttons to switch languages and updating the displayed content in real-time, you will learn how to handle language changes and ensure that the application responds appropriately to the user's input.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Ensure the necessary packages are installed
// npm install i18next react-i18next i18next-http-backend i18next-browser-languagedetector

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { useTranslation, initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import HttpBackend from 'i18next-http-backend';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

// Initialize i18next
i18n
  .use(HttpBackend)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: true,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false, // React already does escaping
    },
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',
    },
  });

const App = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();

  const changeLanguage = (lng) => {
    i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>{t('welcome')}</Text>
      <Button title="English" onPress={() => changeLanguage('en')} />
      <Button title="Spanish" onPress={() => changeLanguage('es')} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An app with buttons to switch between English and Spanish, displaying a welcome message in the selected language, updating dynamically without a reload.

3. **Loading Translations from JSON Files**

**Explanation:**
Loading translations from JSON files involves organizing your translations into separate files for each language and loading them dynamically based on the user's selected language. This practice ensures that your application's localization is scalable and maintainable. By storing translations in JSON files, you can easily update and add new languages without modifying the application code.

In this example, you will learn how to set up your project to load translations from external JSON files. This includes creating the translation files, configuring the backend to load them, and using the translations in your React Native components. This practice helps in managing a large number of translations efficiently and keeping your application code clean.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Ensure the necessary packages are installed
// npm install i18next react-i18next i18next-http-backend i18next-browser-languagedetector

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { useTranslation, initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import HttpBackend from 'i18next-http-backend';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

// Create the translation files in the public/locales folder
// public/locales/en/translation.json
{
  "welcome": "Welcome"
}
// public/locales/es/translation.json
{
  "welcome": "Bienvenido"
}

// Initialize i18next
i18n
  .use(HttpBackend)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: true,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false, // React already does escaping
    },
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json',
    },
  });

const App = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();

  const changeLanguage = (lng) => {
    i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>{t('welcome')}</Text>
      <Button title="English" onPress={() => changeLanguage('en')} />
      <Button title="Spanish" onPress={() => changeLanguage('es')} />
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing a Real-Time Chat Application**

**Explanation:**
Creating a real-time chat application is a common use case for real-time communication techniques. This involves setting up a backend service to handle message exchanges, establishing a WebSocket connection for real-time updates, and creating a user interface for sending and receiving messages. The goal is to enable users to communicate with each other instantly, without delays.

In this example, you will build a simple chat application using WebSockets. You will set up a WebSocket server, connect it to your React Native application, and implement the UI components to display messages and allow users to send new messages. This practice will help you understand the fundamentals of WebSockets and real-time data handling.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install socket.io-client

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://your-server-url'); // Replace with your WebSocket server URL

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('message', (msg) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, msg]);
    });

    return () => {
      socket.off('message');
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('message', message);
    setMessage('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={messages}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.message}>{item}</Text>}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={message}
        onChangeText={setMessage}
        placeholder="Type a message"
      />
      <Button title="Send" onPress={sendMessage} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
  },
  message: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
      Alert.alert('A new FCM message arrived!', JSON.stringify(remoteMessage));
    });

    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    messaging().getToken().then(token => {
      console.log('FCM Token:', token);
    });

    messaging().onTokenRefresh(token => {
      console.log('FCM Token Refreshed:', token);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Real-Time Notifications with Firebase</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

3. **Collaborative Document Editing**

**Explanation:**
Collaborative document editing allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously, with real-time updates reflecting changes made by any user. This feature is commonly seen in applications like Google Docs. Implementing collaborative editing requires handling concurrent updates and conflict resolution.

In this example, you will create a simple collaborative text editor using Firebase Realtime Database. You will set up the database to store document content and synchronize changes in real-time across all connected clients. This practice will demonstrate how to handle real-time data synchronization and conflict management.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/database

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import database from '@react-native-firebase/database';

const documentRef = database().ref('/documents/doc1');

const App = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const onValueChange = documentRef.on('value', snapshot => {
      setText(snapshot.val() || '');
    });

    return () => documentRef.off('value', onValueChange);
  }, []);

  const handleChangeText = (value) => {
    setText(value);
    documentRef.set(value);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={text}
        onChangeText={handleChangeText}
        placeholder="Edit document"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 10,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    height: 200,
    textAlignVertical: 'top',

### Task 6: Implement Real-Time Messaging with Socket.io

#### Explanation

**Understanding Real-Time Messaging with Socket.io**

Real-time messaging is a critical feature in many modern applications, allowing users to communicate instantly. Socket.io is a powerful library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It is built on top of the WebSockets API and provides additional features like automatic reconnection, multiplexing, and handling fallback to HTTP long-polling if WebSockets are not supported.

Implementing real-time messaging with Socket.io in a React Native application involves setting up a Socket.io server and connecting it to your mobile app. The server handles the incoming and outgoing messages, while the client-side application listens for new messages and updates the UI accordingly. This seamless communication channel ensures that messages are delivered instantly, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

#### Online Resources

1. [Socket.io Official Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/)
2. [Building a Real-Time Chat Application with Socket.io](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-server-socket-io)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Setting Up a Basic Socket.io Server**

**Explanation:**
The first step in implementing real-time messaging is to set up a Socket.io server. This server will handle incoming connections and manage message broadcasting to connected clients. Setting up a basic server involves installing the necessary packages, creating a server script, and configuring the server to listen for client connections and messages.

In this example, you will create a simple Node.js server using Socket.io. The server will listen for new client connections and broadcast messages to all connected clients. This foundational setup will enable you to understand how the server handles real-time communication.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// server.js

// Install necessary packages
// npm install express socket.io

const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New client connected');
  socket.on('message', (message) => {
    io.emit('message', message);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

**Expected Output:**
A running Socket.io server that can handle new client connections and broadcast received messages to all clients.

2. [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)

<br>

2. **Creating a React Native Client**

**Explanation:**
After setting up the Socket.io server, the next step is to create a React Native client that can connect to the server and handle real-time messaging. The client will establish a connection to the Socket.io server, send messages, and listen for incoming messages to update the UI.

In this example, you will build a simple React Native application that connects to the Socket.io server. The app will include a text input for sending messages and a list to display received messages in real-time. This practice will demonstrate how to integrate Socket.io with React Native and handle real-time data updates.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install socket.io-client

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://your-server-url'); // Replace with your Socket.io server URL

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('message', (msg) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, msg]);
    });

    return () => {
      socket.off('message');
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('message', message);
    setMessage('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={messages}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text style={styles.message}>{item}</Text>}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={message}
        onChangeText={setMessage}
        placeholder="Type a message"
      />
      <Button title="Send" onPress={sendMessage} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
  },
  message: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
A React Native application where users can send and receive messages in real-time, displayed in a list.

3. **Handling User Authentication and Message History**

**Explanation:**
Enhancing the chat application with user authentication and message history improves the user experience by providing personalized interactions and persistent chat logs. User authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the chat, while message history allows users to view previous conversations.

In this example, you will integrate user authentication and message history into your chat application. You will modify the server to handle user login and store messages in a database. The client will authenticate users and fetch the message history upon connection. This practice will help you understand how to manage user sessions and persist chat data.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// server.js

// Install necessary packages
// npm install express socket.io mongoose

const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/chat', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const messageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: String,
  text: String,
  timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

const Message = mongoose.model('Message', messageSchema);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  Message.find().then((messages) => {
    socket.emit('messageHistory', messages);
  });

  socket.on('message', (message) => {
    const newMessage = new Message(message);
    newMessage.save().then(() => {
      io.emit('message', message);
    });
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

**Client Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install socket.io-client

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://your-server-url'); // Replace with your Socket.io server URL

const App = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState('User1'); // Hardcoded user for simplicity
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('messageHistory', (history) => {
      setMessages(history);
    });

    socket.on('message', (msg) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, msg]);
    });

    return () => {
      socket.off('message');
      socket.off('messageHistory');
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    const newMessage = { user, text: message };
    socket.emit('message', newMessage);

2. [Agora Video Calling API Documentation](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/landing-page)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Setting Up a Basic Video Call with WebRTC**

**Explanation:**
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project that provides APIs for real-time communication. It supports audio, video, and data sharing directly between browsers and mobile applications. Setting up a basic video call with WebRTC involves initializing peer connections, handling media streams, and managing signaling.

In this example, you will set up a simple video calling application using WebRTC. The application will initialize a peer-to-peer connection, access the device's camera and microphone, and establish a video call between two users. This practice will help you understand the core concepts of WebRTC and how to implement real-time video communication.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-webrtc

import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  RTCPeerConnection,
  RTCView,
  mediaDevices,
} from 'react-native-webrtc';

const App = () => {
  const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState(null);
  const [remoteStream, setRemoteStream] = useState(null);
  const pc = useRef(new RTCPeerConnection());

  useEffect(() => {
    const startLocalStream = async () => {
      const stream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      });
      setLocalStream(stream);
      pc.current.addStream(stream);
    };

    startLocalStream();

    pc.current.onaddstream = (event) => {
      setRemoteStream(event.stream);
    };

    // Simulate signaling for demo purposes
    pc.current.createOffer().then((offer) => {
      pc.current.setLocalDescription(offer);
      // Send the offer to the remote peer through signaling server
    });

    // Simulate receiving an answer from the remote peer
    pc.current.onicecandidate = (event) => {
      if (event.candidate) {
        // Send candidate to remote peer
      }
    };

    return () => {
      pc.current.close();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {localStream && <RTCView streamURL={localStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      {remoteStream && <RTCView streamURL={remoteStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      <Button title="Start Call" onPress={() => { /* Handle call start */ }} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  rtcView: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '50%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**

2. **Integrating Agora SDK for Video Calling**

**Explanation:**
Agora provides a comprehensive real-time communication SDK that supports video calling, voice calling, and interactive broadcasting. The Agora SDK simplifies the implementation of video calling features by providing high-level APIs for managing video streams, handling network conditions, and ensuring low-latency communication.

In this example, you will integrate the Agora SDK into a React Native application to enable video calling. The application will include features for joining and leaving video calls, managing user permissions, and displaying video streams. This practice will help you understand how to use a third-party SDK to build a full-featured video calling application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-agora

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet, PermissionsAndroid } from 'react-native';
import RtcEngine, { RtcLocalView, RtcRemoteView, VideoRenderMode } from 'react-native-agora';

const APP_ID = 'YOUR_AGORA_APP_ID'; // Replace with your Agora App ID
const CHANNEL_NAME = 'test';

const App = () => {
  const [joined, setJoined] = useState(false);
  const [engine, setEngine] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const rtcEngine = await RtcEngine.create(APP_ID);
      setEngine(rtcEngine);

      rtcEngine.enableVideo();

      rtcEngine.addListener('UserJoined', (uid, elapsed) => {
        console.log('UserJoined', uid, elapsed);
      });

      rtcEngine.addListener('JoinChannelSuccess', (channel, uid, elapsed) => {
        console.log('JoinChannelSuccess', channel, uid, elapsed);
        setJoined(true);
      });

      await PermissionsAndroid.requestMultiple([
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA,
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.RECORD_AUDIO,
      ]);

      rtcEngine.joinChannel(null, CHANNEL_NAME, null, 0);
    };

    init();

    return () => {
      engine?.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {joined && (
        <RtcLocalView.SurfaceView
          style={styles.localView}
          channelId={CHANNEL_NAME}
          renderMode={VideoRenderMode.Hidden}
        />
      )}
      <Button title="Leave Channel" onPress={() => engine?.leaveChannel()} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  localView: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '50%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

3. **Implementing Group Video Calls with Twilio**

**Explanation:**
Twilio is a cloud communications platform that provides APIs for voice, video, messaging, and authentication. The Twilio Video API enables developers to build real-time video applications with features like group video calls, screen sharing, and recording. Integrating Twilio Video involves creating video rooms, managing participants, and handling video streams.

In this example, you will implement group video calls using the Twilio Video API. The application will allow multiple users to join a video room, display their video streams, and handle user interactions. This practice will help you understand how to build a scalable video calling solution that supports multiple participants.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install twilio-video

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { connect, createLocalVideoTrack } from 'twilio-video';

const TOKEN = 'YOUR_TWILIO_TOKEN'; // Replace with your Twilio token

const App = () => {
  const [room, setRoom] = useState(null);
  const [localVideoTrack, setLocalVideoTrack] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const joinRoom = async () => {
      const videoTrack = await createLocalVideoTrack();
      setLocalVideoTrack(videoTrack);

      const room = await connect(TOKEN, {
        name: 'my-room',
        tracks: [videoTrack],
      });
      setRoom(room);

      room.on('participantConnected', participant => {
        console.log(`Participant "${participant.identity}" connected`);
        participant.tracks.forEach(publication => {
          if (publication.isSubscribed) {
            const track = publication.track;
            document.getElementById('remote-media-div').appendChild(track.attach());
          }
        });

        participant.on('trackSubscribed', track => {
          document.getElementById('remote-media-div').appendChild(track.attach());
        });
      });

      room.on('participantDisconnected', participant => {
        console.log(`Participant "${participant.identity}" disconnected`);
      });
    };

    joinRoom();

    return () => {
      room?.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View id="remote-media-div" style={styles.remoteView

}></View>
      {localVideoTrack && (
        <View style={styles.localView}>
          <video ref={ref => ref && ref.appendChild(localVideoTrack.attach())} autoPlay />
        </View>
      )}
      <Button title="Leave Room" onPress={() => room?.disconnect()} />
    </View>
  );
};

### Task 8: Integrate Video Calling with WebRTC

#### Explanation

**Understanding Video Calling with WebRTC**

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project that provides APIs for peer-to-peer communication. It supports real-time video, voice, and data sharing directly between browsers and mobile applications without the need for intermediary servers. WebRTC's core components include media capture devices (like webcams and microphones), peer-to-peer connection management, and real-time media exchange. This technology is ideal for building applications that require real-time communication, such as video calling, live streaming, and online gaming.

Integrating WebRTC into a React Native application involves setting up media streams, managing peer connections, and handling signaling for establishing the connections. Signaling is the process of coordinating communication between peers by exchanging metadata, such as session descriptions and ICE candidates, to establish a direct connection. By mastering these concepts, developers can create robust and efficient real-time communication applications.

#### Online Resources

2. [React Native WebRTC GitHub](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Setting Up a Basic WebRTC Connection**

**Explanation:**
The first step in integrating WebRTC into a React Native application is to establish a basic peer-to-peer connection. This involves accessing the device's camera and microphone, creating a local media stream, and setting up a peer connection. You will also need to implement a simple signaling mechanism to exchange connection information between peers.

In this example, you will create a basic video calling application using WebRTC. The app will initialize a local media stream, display the video feed, and establish a peer-to-peer connection to exchange video streams between two users. This practice will help you understand the fundamentals of WebRTC and how to set up a basic video call.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-webrtc

import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  RTCPeerConnection,
  RTCView,
  mediaDevices,
} from 'react-native-webrtc';

const App = () => {
  const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState(null);
  const [remoteStream, setRemoteStream] = useState(null);
  const pc = useRef(new RTCPeerConnection());

  useEffect(() => {
    const startLocalStream = async () => {
      const stream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      });
      setLocalStream(stream);
      pc.current.addStream(stream);
    };

    startLocalStream();

    pc.current.onaddstream = (event) => {
      setRemoteStream(event.stream);
    };

    // Simulate signaling for demo purposes
    pc.current.createOffer().then((offer) => {
      pc.current.setLocalDescription(offer);
      // Send the offer to the remote peer through signaling server
    });

    // Simulate receiving an answer from the remote peer
    pc.current.onicecandidate = (event) => {
      if (event.candidate) {
        // Send candidate to remote peer
      }
    };

    return () => {
      pc.current.close();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {localStream && <RTCView streamURL={localStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      {remoteStream && <RTCView streamURL={remoteStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      <Button title="Start Call" onPress={() => { /* Handle call start */ }} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  rtcView: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '50%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
A basic video calling application that displays local and remote video streams.

2. **Implementing Signaling with WebSocket**

**Explanation:**
Signaling is essential for establishing and managing WebRTC connections. It involves exchanging information such as session descriptions and ICE candidates between peers to set up the connection. WebSocket is commonly used for signaling due to its low latency and full-duplex communication capabilities. By integrating WebSocket with WebRTC, you can create a robust signaling mechanism to manage peer connections.

In this example, you will implement signaling using WebSocket to enable real-time communication between peers. The application will use WebSocket to exchange connection information, set up a peer-to-peer connection, and handle video streams. This practice will help you understand how to combine WebSocket and WebRTC for effective signaling.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-webrtc socket.io-client

import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  RTCPeerConnection,
  RTCView,
  mediaDevices,
} from 'react-native-webrtc';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://your-server-url'); // Replace with your WebSocket server URL

const App = () => {
  const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState(null);
  const [remoteStream, setRemoteStream] = useState(null);
  const pc = useRef(new RTCPeerConnection());

  useEffect(() => {
    const startLocalStream = async () => {
      const stream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      });
      setLocalStream(stream);
      pc.current.addStream(stream);
    };

    startLocalStream();

    pc.current.onaddstream = (event) => {
      setRemoteStream(event.stream);
    };

    socket.on('offer', (offer) => {
      pc.current.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));
      pc.current.createAnswer().then((answer) => {
        pc.current.setLocalDescription(answer);
        socket.emit('answer', answer);
      });
    });

    socket.on('answer', (answer) => {
      pc.current.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
    });

    socket.on('candidate', (candidate) => {
      pc.current.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
    });

    pc.current.onicecandidate = (event) => {
      if (event.candidate) {
        socket.emit('candidate', event.candidate);
      }
    };

    return () => {
      pc.current.close();
      socket.off('offer');
      socket.off('answer');
      socket.off('candidate');
    };
  }, []);

  const startCall = () => {
    pc.current.createOffer().then((offer) => {
      pc.current.setLocalDescription(offer);
      socket.emit('offer', offer);
    });
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {localStream && <RTCView streamURL={localStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      {remoteStream && <RTCView streamURL={remoteStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      <Button title="Start Call" onPress={startCall} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  rtcView: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '50%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
A video calling application that uses WebSocket for signaling to establish a WebRTC connection and exchange video streams.

3. **Adding Multiple Participants (Group Video Call)**

**Explanation:**
Group video calls involve managing multiple peer connections simultaneously. This requires setting up multiple RTCPeerConnection instances, handling signaling for each participant, and managing media streams. Implementing group video calls can be more complex due to the need to synchronize multiple video streams and handle potential network issues.

In this example, you will extend the video calling application to support multiple participants. Each participant will establish peer connections with all other participants, and the application will manage the signaling and media streams for the group call. This practice will help you understand how to scale WebRTC applications for group video communication.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-webrtc socket.io-client

import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  RTCPeerConnection,
  RTCView,
  mediaDevices,
} from 'react-native-webrtc';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://your-server-url'); // Replace with your WebSocket server URL

const App = () => {
  const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState(null);
  const [remoteStreams, setRemoteStreams] = useState([]);
  const pc = useRef(new RTCPeerConnection());
  const peerConnections = useRef({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const startLocalStream = async () => {
      const stream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      });
      setLocalStream(stream

);
    };

    startLocalStream();

    socket.on('newParticipant', (participantId) => {
      const newPc = new RTCPeerConnection();
      newPc.addStream(localStream);

      newPc.onaddstream = (event) => {
        setRemoteStreams((prevStreams) => [
          ...prevStreams,
          { id: participantId, stream: event.stream },
        ]);
      };

      newPc.onicecandidate = (event) => {
        if (event.candidate) {
          socket.emit('candidate', participantId, event.candidate);
        }
      };

      peerConnections.current[participantId] = newPc;

      newPc.createOffer().then((offer) => {
        newPc.setLocalDescription(offer);
        socket.emit('offer', participantId, offer);
      });
    });

    socket.on('offer', (participantId, offer) => {
      const newPc = new RTCPeerConnection();
      newPc.addStream(localStream);

      newPc.onaddstream = (event) => {
        setRemoteStreams((prevStreams) => [
          ...prevStreams,
          { id: participantId, stream: event.stream },
        ]);
      };

      newPc.onicecandidate = (event) => {
        if (event.candidate) {
          socket.emit('candidate', participantId, event.candidate);
        }
      };

      newPc.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));
      newPc.createAnswer().then((answer) => {
        newPc.setLocalDescription(answer);
        socket.emit('answer', participantId, answer);
      });

      peerConnections.current[participantId] = newPc;
    });

    socket.on('answer', (participantId, answer) => {
      const pc = peerConnections.current[participantId];
      pc.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
    });

    socket.on('candidate', (participantId, candidate) => {
      const pc = peerConnections.current[participantId];
      pc.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
    });

    socket.on('participantLeft', (participantId) => {
      const pc = peerConnections.current[participantId];
      pc.close();
      delete peerConnections.current[participantId];
      setRemoteStreams((prevStreams) =>
        prevStreams.filter((stream) => stream.id !== participantId)
      );
    });

    return () => {
      Object.values(peerConnections.current).forEach((pc) => pc.close());
      socket.off('newParticipant');
      socket.off('offer');
      socket.off('answer');
      socket.off('candidate');
      socket.off('participantLeft');
    };
  }, [localStream]);

  const joinCall = () => {
    socket.emit('join');
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {localStream && <RTCView streamURL={localStream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />}
      {remoteStreams.map(({ id, stream }) => (
        <RTCView key={id} streamURL={stream.toURL()} style={styles.rtcView} />
      ))}
      <Button title="Join Call" onPress={joinCall} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({

### Task 9: Study Offline-First Design Principles

#### Explanation

**Understanding Offline-First Design Principles**

Offline-first design principles focus on creating applications that provide a seamless user experience even when there is no network connectivity. This approach prioritizes the local availability of data and functionality, ensuring that users can continue to interact with the application without interruptions. By designing with offline capabilities in mind, developers can build resilient applications that synchronize data with the server when a connection is re-established.

Implementing offline-first design involves using local storage solutions, such as SQLite, AsyncStorage, or Realm, to store data on the device. It also includes techniques like caching, data synchronization, and conflict resolution. By adopting these practices, developers can enhance the reliability and usability of their applications, particularly in environments with inconsistent or limited connectivity.

2. [Offline-First Design Guide](https://pouchdb.com/guides/offline-first.html)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing Local Storage with AsyncStorage**

**Explanation:**
AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous storage API for React Native. It is a key-value store that allows developers to persist data locally on the device. AsyncStorage is useful for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences, settings, and simple state information.

In this example, you will learn how to use AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data locally in a React Native application. The application will include a simple form to save user preferences, which will be persisted across app restarts. This practice will help you understand the basics of local storage and how to manage persistent data in your app.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const App = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [storedName, setStoredName] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadName = async () => {
      try {
        const savedName = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userName');
        if (savedName) {
          setStoredName(savedName);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load name', error);
      }
    };
    loadName();
  }, []);

  const saveName = async () => {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('userName', name);
      setStoredName(name);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to save name', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Offline-First Example</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={name}
        onChangeText={setName}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <Button title="Save" onPress={saveName} />
      {storedName ? <Text style={styles.storedName}>Stored Name: {storedName}</Text> : null}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  storedName: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 18,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to enter and save their name, which is persisted across app restarts using AsyncStorage.

2. **Caching Data with React Query**

**Explanation:**
React Query is a powerful library for managing server-state in React applications. It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating, making it an excellent tool for offline-first applications. By using React Query, developers can cache data locally and keep it in sync with the server, providing a seamless offline experience.

In this example, you will use React Query to cache data fetched from an API. The application will display a list of items fetched from the server, and the data will be cached locally to ensure it remains available when offline. This practice will help you understand how to implement caching and manage server-state in a React Native application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-query axios

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider, useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const fetchItems = async () => {
  const { data } = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return data;
};

const ItemList = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('items', fetchItems);

  if (isLoading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <View style={styles.item}>
          <Text style={styles.title}>{item.title}</Text>
          <Text>{item.body}</Text>
        </View>
      )}
    />
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>

3. **Synchronizing Local and Remote Data with Realm**

**Explanation:**
Realm is a mobile database that provides offline-first functionality and real-time data synchronization. It allows developers to store data locally on the device and synchronize it with a remote database when connectivity is available. This approach ensures that users can access and modify data offline, with changes being synced automatically once the connection is restored.

In this example, you will use Realm to store data locally and synchronize it with a remote server. The application will include a simple form to add new items, which will be saved locally and synced with the server. This practice will help you understand how to use Realm to manage offline data and ensure seamless synchronization.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install realm

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, FlatList, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import Realm from 'realm';

const ItemSchema = {
  name: 'Item',
  properties: {
    _id: 'int',
    name: 'string',
  },
  primaryKey: '_id',
};

const App = () => {
  const [realm, setRealm] = useState(null);
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    Realm.open({ schema: [ItemSchema] }).then((realm) => {
      setRealm(realm);
      const items = realm.objects('Item');
      setItems([...items]);
      items.addListener(() => {
        setItems([...items]);
      });
    });

    return () => {
      realm?.close();
    };
  }, []);

  const addItem = () => {
    if (realm) {
      realm.write(() => {
        realm.create('Item', { _id: Date.now(), name });
      });
      setName('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>Realm Offline-First Example</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={name}
        onChangeText={setName}
        placeholder="Enter item name"
      />
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
      <FlatList
        data={items}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item._id.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style

={styles.item}>
            <Text>{item.name}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  header: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 20,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to add items, which are stored locally using Realm and synchronized with a remote server when connectivity is available.

### Task 10: Implement Offline Capabilities with Service Workers

#### Explanation

**Understanding Service Workers**

Service workers are a key component of progressive web apps (PWAs) that enable offline capabilities, background synchronization, and push notifications. A service worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from the web page, allowing it to intercept network requests and serve cached responses. This makes it possible to provide a seamless user experience even when the user is offline or experiencing poor network connectivity.

In the context of React Native, service workers are not natively supported, but similar offline capabilities can be achieved using libraries like Workbox or implementing caching strategies manually. These tools help manage the caching of assets and data, ensuring that the application remains functional and responsive even when offline. By leveraging service workers or similar mechanisms, developers can enhance the reliability and usability of their applications.

#### Online Resources

1. [Service Workers: An Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)
2. [Workbox Documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing Basic Service Worker for Offline Caching**

**Explanation:**
To implement offline capabilities using a service worker, you need to register the service worker, cache essential assets, and serve those assets from the cache when the network is unavailable. This involves creating a service worker script that defines the caching behavior and registering it in your application.

In this example, you will create a basic service worker that caches the main HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of a web application. The service worker will intercept network requests and serve the cached files when offline, ensuring that the application remains functional without a network connection.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// service-worker.js

const CACHE_NAME = 'offline-cache-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/styles.css',
  '/script.js',
];

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then(cache => {
        return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
      })
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => {
        return response || fetch(event.request);
      })
  );
});
```

```javascript
// Register the service worker in your main script file (e.g., index.js)

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => {
        console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
      });
  });
}
```

**Expected Output:**
A web application that caches essential assets and remains functional when offline, serving cached files instead of making network requests.

2. [Introduction to Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker)

<br>

2. **Using Workbox for Enhanced Caching Strategies**

**Explanation:**
Workbox is a set of libraries and tools that make it easy to add offline capabilities and caching strategies to web applications. Workbox simplifies the implementation of service workers by providing high-level APIs for common tasks like precaching, runtime caching, and background synchronization. By using Workbox, developers can implement advanced caching strategies with minimal effort.

In this example, you will use Workbox to implement a service worker with enhanced caching strategies. The service worker will precache static assets and use runtime caching for API responses, ensuring that both the application shell and dynamic content are available offline. This practice will demonstrate how to leverage Workbox to manage caching effectively.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install Workbox CLI globally
// npm install -g workbox-cli

// Generate a service worker using Workbox
// workbox generateSW

// workbox-config.js

module.exports = {
  "globDirectory": "dist/",
  "globPatterns": [
    "**/*.{html,js,css}"
  ],
  "swDest": "dist/service-worker.js",
  "runtimeCaching": [{
    "urlPattern": /https:\/\/api\.example\.com\/data/,
    "handler": "NetworkFirst",
    "options": {
      "cacheName": "api-cache",
      "expiration": {
        "maxEntries": 10,
        "maxAgeSeconds": 300
      }
    }
  }]
};

// Register the Workbox-generated service worker in your main script file (e.g., index.js)

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => {
        console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
      });
  });
}
```

**Expected Output:**
A web application that uses Workbox to implement precaching and runtime caching strategies, providing offline support for both static assets and dynamic API responses.

3. **Offline Data Synchronization with IndexedDB**

**Explanation:**
For more complex offline-first applications that need to store and synchronize large amounts of data, IndexedDB is a suitable choice. IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing significant amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It allows for efficient querying and is designed to work well with web applications that need to function offline.

In this example, you will implement offline data synchronization using IndexedDB. The application will store data locally in IndexedDB and synchronize it with a remote server when the network connection is available. This practice will help you understand how to manage offline data storage and synchronization in web applications.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// IndexedDB setup
const dbPromise = idb.open('offline-db', 1, upgradeDB => {
  if (!upgradeDB.objectStoreNames.contains('posts')) {
    upgradeDB.createObjectStore('posts', { keyPath: 'id' });
  }
});

// Service worker for syncing
self.addEventListener('sync', event => {
  if (event.tag === 'sync-new-posts') {
    event.waitUntil(syncPosts());
  }
});

function syncPosts() {
  return dbPromise.then(db => {
    const tx = db.transaction('posts', 'readonly');
    const store = tx.objectStore('posts');
    return store.getAll();
  }).then(posts => {
    return Promise.all(posts.map(post => {
      return fetch('/api/posts', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(post),
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      }).then(response => {
        if (response.ok) {
          return dbPromise.then(db => {
            const tx = db.transaction('posts', 'readwrite');
            const store = tx.objectStore('posts');
            store.delete(post.id);
            return tx.complete;
          });
        }
      });
    }));
  });
}

// Function to save post locally and register sync
function savePostLocally(post) {
  dbPromise.then(db => {
    const tx = db.transaction('posts', 'readwrite');
    const store = tx.objectStore('posts');
    store.put(post);
    return tx.complete;
  }).then(() => {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'SyncManager' in window) {
      navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(sw => {
        return sw.sync.register('sync-new-posts');
      });
    }
  });
}
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that stores data in IndexedDB when offline and synchronizes it with a remote server when the network connection is restored.

### Task 11: Study Advanced Security Practices

#### Explanation

**Understanding Advanced Security Practices**

Advanced security practices in software development involve implementing strategies and techniques to protect applications from various threats, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyberattacks. In the context of React Native, this includes secure coding practices, data encryption, authentication, authorization, and secure communication. By adhering to these practices, developers can ensure that their applications are robust and resilient against security vulnerabilities.

Key security practices for React Native applications include using secure storage for sensitive data, implementing strong authentication mechanisms (such as OAuth and biometric authentication), and ensuring secure communication through HTTPS and certificate pinning. Additionally, developers should regularly update dependencies, perform code reviews, and conduct security testing to identify and mitigate potential risks. These practices collectively contribute to creating a secure environment for both users and their data.

#### Online Resources

2. [React Native Security Best Practices](https://reactnative.dev/docs/security)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing Secure Storage with React Native Keychain**

**Explanation:**
Secure storage is crucial for protecting sensitive information such as authentication tokens, passwords, and user credentials. React Native Keychain is a library that provides secure storage for sensitive data using the native keychain services on iOS and Android. This ensures that data is stored securely and is protected by the operating system's security features.

In this example, you will use React Native Keychain to store and retrieve sensitive data securely. The application will include a form for saving user credentials, which will be encrypted and stored in the keychain. This practice will help you understand how to implement secure storage in your React Native applications.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install react-native-keychain

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';

const App = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const saveCredentials = async () => {
    try {
      await Keychain.setGenericPassword(username, password);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Credentials saved securely!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save credentials');
    }
  };

  const loadCredentials = async () => {
    try {
      const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword();
      if (credentials) {
        Alert.alert('Success', `Username: ${credentials.username}, Password: ${credentials.password}`);
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'No credentials stored');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to load credentials');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        placeholder="Username"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        placeholder="Password"
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Save Credentials" onPress={saveCredentials} />
      <Button title="Load Credentials" onPress={loadCredentials} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to securely store and retrieve credentials using React Native Keychain.

2. **Implementing Biometric Authentication**

**Explanation:**
Biometric authentication provides an additional layer of security by allowing users to authenticate using their fingerprint or facial recognition. This method enhances security by ensuring that only the authorized user can access the application. React Native Biometrics is a library that enables biometric authentication in React Native applications.

In this example, you will use React Native Biometrics to implement biometric authentication. The application will include a button to authenticate the user using their biometric data. This practice will help you understand how to integrate biometric authentication into your React Native applications, providing a secure and convenient login method.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install react-native-biometrics

import React from 'react';
import { View, Button, Alert, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import ReactNativeBiometrics from 'react-native-biometrics';

const App = () => {
  const authenticate = async () => {
    const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics();

    const { available, biometryType } = await rnBiometrics.isSensorAvailable();

    if (available && biometryType === ReactNativeBiometrics.TouchID) {
      rnBiometrics.simplePrompt({ promptMessage: 'Confirm fingerprint' })
        .then(resultObject => {
          const { success } = resultObject;

          if (success) {
            Alert.alert('Success', 'Authenticated successfully!');
          } else {
            Alert.alert('Error', 'Authentication failed');
          }
        })
        .catch(() => {
          Alert.alert('Error', 'Biometrics failed');
        });
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Biometrics not supported');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Authenticate with Biometrics" onPress={authenticate} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to authenticate using their fingerprint, providing an additional layer of security.

3. **Implementing Secure Communication with HTTPS and Certificate Pinning**

**Explanation:**
Secure communication ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and protected from interception. HTTPS provides encrypted communication using SSL/TLS, while certificate pinning adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that the client only accepts a specific server certificate. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept or modify the communication.

In this example, you will configure your React Native application to use HTTPS for secure communication and implement certificate pinning using a library like react-native-ssl-pinning. The application will make a secure API request, ensuring that the communication is encrypted and the server certificate is verified. This practice will help you understand how to secure network communication in your applications.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install react-native-ssl-pinning

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';
import { RNSslPinning } from 'react-native-ssl-pinning';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://your-secure-api.com/data', {
          httpsAgent: new RNSslPinning({
            sslPinning: {
              certs: ['your_cert_name'], // Add your certificate name here
            },
          }),
        });
        setData(response.data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {data ? <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text> : <Text>Loading...</Text>}
      {error && <Text style={styles.error}>Error: {error}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that makes a secure API request using HTTPS and certificate pinning, ensuring encrypted communication and server certificate verification.

### Task 12: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication

#### Explanation

**Understanding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or VPN. Rather than just asking for a password, MFA involves additional factors such as a verification code sent to a user's mobile device, biometric verification, or a security token. This layered approach significantly increases security by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access sensitive information.

Implementing MFA in a React Native application typically involves integrating a backend service that supports MFA, such as Firebase Authentication or Auth0. These services handle the complexities of managing user authentication, generating verification codes, and verifying additional factors. By incorporating MFA, developers can enhance the security of their applications, providing an additional layer of protection for user accounts and sensitive data.

#### Online Resources

1. [Multi-Factor Authentication with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/mfa)
2. [Auth0 Multi-Factor Authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/multi-factor-authentication)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing MFA with Firebase Authentication**

**Explanation:**
Firebase Authentication provides an easy-to-use platform for implementing MFA. It supports various authentication methods, including email/password, phone numbers, and third-party providers like Google and Facebook. For MFA, Firebase allows you to add a second factor, such as an SMS code, to enhance security.

In this example, you will set up Firebase Authentication and implement MFA using phone number verification. The application will require users to sign in with their email and password, followed by entering a verification code sent to their phone. This practice will help you understand how to integrate Firebase Authentication and implement MFA in your React Native application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';

const App = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [phoneNumber, setPhoneNumber] = useState('');
  const [verificationCode, setVerificationCode] = useState('');
  const [confirmResult, setConfirmResult] = useState(null);

  const signInWithEmailAndPassword = async () => {
    try {
      await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Signed in successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.message);
    }
  };

  const sendVerificationCode = async () => {
    try {
      const confirmation = await auth().signInWithPhoneNumber(phoneNumber);
      setConfirmResult(confirmation);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.message);
    }
  };

  const confirmVerificationCode = async () => {
    try {
      await confirmResult.confirm(verificationCode);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Phone number verified successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid verification code');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={email}
        onChangeText={setEmail}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        placeholder="Password"
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Sign In" onPress={signInWithEmailAndPassword} />

      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={phoneNumber}
        onChangeText={setPhoneNumber}
        placeholder="Phone Number"
      />
      <Button title="Send Verification Code" onPress={sendVerificationCode} />

      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={verificationCode}
        onChangeText={setVerificationCode}
        placeholder="Verification Code"
      />
      <Button title="Confirm Code" onPress={confirmVerificationCode} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',

2. **Implementing MFA with Auth0**

**Explanation:**
Auth0 provides a flexible and robust platform for implementing MFA. It supports various second factors, such as SMS, email, push notifications, and TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password). By integrating Auth0 into your React Native application, you can leverage its comprehensive security features to implement MFA seamlessly.

In this example, you will set up Auth0 and implement MFA using TOTP. The application will require users to log in with their credentials, followed by entering a TOTP generated by an authenticator app. This practice will help you understand how to integrate Auth0 and implement MFA in your React Native application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-auth0

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import Auth0 from 'react-native-auth0';

const auth0 = new Auth0({
  domain: 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN',
  clientId: 'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
});

const App = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [totp, setTotp] = useState('');
  const [accessToken, setAccessToken] = useState(null);

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await auth0.auth.passwordRealm({
        username,
        password,
        realm: 'Username-Password-Authentication',
        audience: 'YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER',
        scope: 'openid profile email',
      });
      setAccessToken(response.accessToken);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Logged in successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.message);
    }
  };

  const verifyTotp = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await auth0.auth.loginWithOTP({
        mfa_token: accessToken,
        otp: totp,
      });
      Alert.alert('Success', 'TOTP verified successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid TOTP');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        placeholder="Username"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        placeholder="Password"
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />

      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={totp}
        onChangeText={setTotp}
        placeholder="TOTP"
      />
      <Button title="Verify TOTP" onPress={verifyTotp} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to log in with username and password, followed by TOTP verification using Auth0.

<br>

3. **Implementing MFA with One-Time Passwords (OTP) via Email**

**Explanation:**
One-time passwords (OTP) sent via email provide an additional layer of security by requiring users to enter a temporary code sent to their email address. This method is widely used for MFA because it combines something the user knows (their password) with something they have (access to their email).

In this example, you will implement MFA using OTP sent via email. The application will require users to log in with their email and password, followed by entering an OTP received in their email. This practice will help you understand how to implement OTP-based MFA in your React Native application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install axios

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [otp, setOtp] = useState('');
  const [otpSent, setOtpSent] = useState(false);

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('

https://your-api.com/login', { email, password });
      if (response.data.success) {
        setOtpSent(true);
        Alert.alert('Success', 'OTP sent to your email');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid credentials');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.message);
    }
  };

  const verifyOtp = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('https://your-api.com/verify-otp', { email, otp });
      if (response.data.success) {
        Alert.alert('Success', 'Logged in successfully!');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid OTP');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={email}
        onChangeText={setEmail}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        placeholder="Password"
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />

      {otpSent && (
        <>
          <TextInput
            style={styles.input}
            value={otp}
            onChangeText={setOtp}
            placeholder="OTP"
          />
          <Button title="Verify OTP" onPress={verifyOtp} />
        </>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

### Task 13: Study API Security Best Practices

#### Explanation

**Understanding API Security Best Practices**

API security is critical for protecting the data and functionalities exposed by your backend services from unauthorized access and misuse. Implementing security best practices ensures that your APIs are resilient against various threats, such as data breaches, injection attacks, and denial of service attacks. Key best practices include using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, validating inputs, encrypting data, and implementing rate limiting and monitoring.

Authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth and JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensure that only authenticated users can access your APIs, and they are authorized to perform specific actions. Input validation helps prevent injection attacks by ensuring that inputs conform to expected formats. Data encryption protects sensitive information during transmission, while rate limiting and monitoring help mitigate the impact of potential abuse and identify suspicious activities.

2. [API Security Best Practices](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/api-security-best-practices/)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing JWT Authentication**

**Explanation:**
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact and self-contained way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWT is commonly used for authentication and authorization in modern applications. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client stores the token and includes it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected routes.

In this example, you will implement JWT authentication in a React Native application. The application will include a login form, and upon successful login, the server will return a JWT. The client will store the token and use it to authenticate subsequent API requests. This practice will help you understand how to implement secure token-based authentication.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Server-side (Node.js)
// Install necessary packages
// npm install express jsonwebtoken body-parser

const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;
const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key';

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // Validate username and password (in a real app, use a database)
  if (username === 'user' && password === 'pass') {
    const token = jwt.sign({ username }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});

app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];
  if (!token) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'No token provided' });

  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to authenticate token' });

    res.json({ message: 'Protected data', user: decoded.username });
  });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

```javascript
// Client-side (React Native)
// Install necessary packages
// npm install axios

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [token, setToken] = useState('');

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/login', { username, password });
      setToken(response.data.token);
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Logged in successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Invalid credentials');
    }
  };

  const getProtectedData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/protected', {
        headers: { Authorization: token },
      });
      Alert.alert('Protected Data', `User: ${response.data.user}`);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch protected data');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        placeholder="Username"
      />
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        placeholder="Password"
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />
      {token && <Button title="Get Protected Data" onPress={getProtectedData} />}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  input: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that allows users to log in, receive a JWT, and access protected routes using the token.

2. **Implementing Rate Limiting**

**Explanation:**
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests a user can make to an API within a specific time frame. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage among all users. Rate limiting can be implemented at the API gateway, server, or application level. It typically involves setting a maximum number of requests allowed per user, IP address, or API key within a defined period.

In this example, you will implement rate limiting in a Node.js application using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. The middleware will limit the number of requests a user can make to a specific endpoint, providing a simple mechanism to protect your API from abuse. This practice will help you understand how to implement rate limiting in your backend services.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Server-side (Node.js)
// Install necessary packages
// npm install express express-rate-limit

const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later',
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);

app.get('/api/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Welcome to the API!' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Client-side Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const fetchApi = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/');
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', error.response.data);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Fetch API" onPress={fetchApi} />
      {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that limits the number of requests a user can make to the API within a specified time frame, preventing abuse.

3. **Implementing Data Encryption with HTTPS**

**Explanation:**
Encrypting data during transmission ensures that sensitive information, such as user credentials and personal data, is protected from interception and eavesdropping. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the standard protocol for secure communication over the internet. It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data between the client and server, providing a secure channel for data exchange.

In this example, you will configure a Node.js server to use HTTPS for secure communication. The server will use an SSL certificate to encrypt data, ensuring that all communication between the client and server is secure. This practice will help you understand how to implement HTTPS in your backend services.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Server-side (Node.js)
// Generate SSL certificate and key (self-signed for development)
// openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert

const express = require('express');
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync

('server.cert'),
};

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Secure communication with HTTPS!' });
});

https.createServer(options, app).listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Client-side Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const fetchApi = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://localhost:3000/');
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch secure data');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Fetch Secure API" onPress={fetchApi} />
      {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that uses HTTPS to encrypt data during transmission, ensuring secure communication between the client and server.

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const data = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => ({ key: `Item ${i}` }));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.item}>
            <Text>{item.key}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({

### Task 17: Study Memory Management Techniques

#### Explanation

**Understanding Memory Management Techniques**

Memory management in React Native is crucial for building efficient and performant applications. Proper memory management involves monitoring and optimizing the usage of memory by various components and processes in your app. Common memory issues include memory leaks, excessive memory consumption, and inefficient memory allocation. Addressing these issues can prevent your app from crashing and ensure a smooth user experience.

React Native provides tools and best practices for effective memory management, such as using the `useEffect` hook for cleanup, optimizing image loading and caching, and leveraging the garbage collector. Additionally, profiling tools like React Native Debugger and Flipper can help identify memory issues by providing detailed insights into memory allocation and usage. By understanding and implementing these techniques, developers can create applications that efficiently utilize memory resources.

#### Online Resources

1. [React Native Memory Management Best Practices](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#memory-optimization)
2. [Avoiding Memory Leaks in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Using the `useEffect` Hook for Cleanup**

**Explanation:**
The `useEffect` hook in React is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations. It also provides a way to clean up after these effects to prevent memory leaks. By returning a cleanup function from the `useEffect` hook, you can ensure that any subscriptions or event listeners are properly removed when the component unmounts.

In this example, you will create a component that sets up an interval to fetch data periodically and clean up the interval when the component unmounts. This practice will help you understand how to use the `useEffect` hook for managing side effects and preventing memory leaks.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function to clear the interval
    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that increments a counter every second, with proper cleanup of the interval to prevent memory leaks.

<br>

2. **Optimizing Image Loading and Caching**

**Explanation:**
Images can consume a significant amount of memory, especially in mobile applications. Optimizing image loading and caching can help reduce memory usage and improve performance. Techniques include using the `Image` component's `resizeMode` property, leveraging image caching libraries like `react-native-fast-image`, and managing image sizes to match the display dimensions.

In this example, you will use the `react-native-fast-image` library to load and cache images efficiently. This library provides advanced caching capabilities and supports progressive loading, which helps reduce memory usage and improve the user experience.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary package
// npm install react-native-fast-image

import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import FastImage from 'react-native-fast-image';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FastImage
        style={styles.image}
        source={{
          uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
          priority: FastImage.priority.high,
        }}
        resizeMode={FastImage.resizeMode.contain}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  image: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that loads and caches an image efficiently using the `react-native-fast-image` library.

3. **Monitoring Memory Usage with Flipper**

**Explanation:**
Flipper is a debugging platform for mobile apps, including React Native applications. It provides tools for inspecting network activity, logs, and memory usage. The memory plugin in Flipper allows you to monitor memory allocation and identify potential memory leaks in your application. By using Flipper, you can gain insights into your app's memory usage and optimize it accordingly.

In this example, you will integrate Flipper into your React Native application and use it to monitor memory usage. The application will include a component that loads a large amount of data, and you will analyze the memory usage to identify potential optimizations.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Enable Flipper integration (in your React Native project)

// android/app/src/main/java/com/yourapp/MainApplication.java
import com.facebook.flipper.android.AndroidFlipperClient;
import com.facebook.flipper.android.utils.FlipperUtils;
import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader;
import com.facebook.react.ReactInstanceManager;
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.shell.MainReactPackage;
import com.facebook.flipper.plugins.network.FlipperOkhttpInterceptor;
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;

// Inside onCreate method
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG && FlipperUtils.shouldEnableFlipper(this)) {
  final ReactInstanceManager reactInstanceManager = getReactNativeHost().getReactInstanceManager();
  AndroidFlipperClient.getInstance(this).addPlugin(new NetworkFlipperPlugin());
}

// Use FlipperOkhttpInterceptor for network inspection
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
  .addNetworkInterceptor(new FlipperOkhttpInterceptor(networkFlipperPlugin))
  .build();

// App component to monitor memory usage
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const generateData = () => {
  return Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => ({ key: `Item ${i}` }));
};

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(generateData());
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.item}>
            <Text>{item.key}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.key}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

### Task 18: Optimize Memory Usage with Garbage Collection

#### Explanation

**Understanding Garbage Collection**

Garbage collection is an automatic memory management feature that helps in reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. This process is crucial for preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient use of memory resources. In the context of React Native, JavaScript's garbage collector plays a vital role in managing the memory allocated for the application. The garbage collector identifies and removes objects that are no longer reachable, thereby freeing up memory and improving application performance.

However, relying solely on garbage collection can sometimes be insufficient, especially if there are underlying issues such as memory leaks caused by improper management of references and resources. Developers must understand how garbage collection works and adopt best practices to optimize memory usage proactively. This includes avoiding memory leaks by cleaning up event listeners, timers, and other resources that can hold references to objects unnecessarily.

#### Online Resources

1. [Understanding Memory Leaks in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects)
2. [JavaScript Memory Management: What You Need to Know](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-memory-management-what-you-need-to-know-7d2a72b491fa/)

#### Examples to Practice

1. **Cleaning Up Event Listeners**

**Explanation:**
Event listeners can cause memory leaks if they are not properly cleaned up. When an event listener is attached to a DOM element or a component, it holds a reference to the handler function and the element itself. If these listeners are not removed when the component is unmounted, the references remain, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming the memory. This can lead to increased memory usage and degraded performance over time.

In this example, you will create a component that sets up an event listener and cleans it up when the component unmounts. This practice helps you understand how to manage event listeners properly and prevent memory leaks in your React Native applications.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleEvent = () => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    };

    window.addEventListener('click', handleEvent);

    // Cleanup function to remove the event listener
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('click', handleEvent);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Click Count: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that increments a counter when the window is clicked, with proper cleanup of the event listener to prevent memory leaks.

2. [JavaScript Event Listeners: The Definitive Guide](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-event-listener/)

<br>

2. **Managing Timers and Intervals**

**Explanation:**
Timers and intervals, such as those created with `setTimeout` and `setInterval`, can also lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. These functions hold references to their callback functions and keep them in memory until they are cleared. If timers are not cleared when they are no longer needed, they can prevent the garbage collector from freeing up memory, leading to increased memory usage.

In this example, you will create a component that sets up a timer to update the state periodically and cleans up the timer when the component unmounts. This practice helps you understand how to manage timers and intervals properly to optimize memory usage and prevent leaks.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function to clear the interval

3. **Optimizing Large Data Structures**

**Explanation:**
Handling large data structures efficiently is crucial for optimizing memory usage. Keeping large arrays or objects in memory can lead to high memory consumption, especially if they are not needed after a certain point. By using techniques such as pagination, lazy loading, and efficient data structures, you can minimize memory usage and improve the performance of your application.

In this example, you will implement a component that handles a large list of items using pagination. This approach ensures that only a subset of the data is loaded into memory at any given time, reducing the overall memory footprint of the application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const generateData = (page) => {
  return Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, i) => ({ key: `Item ${page * 20 + i}` }));
};

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = () => {
      const newData = generateData(page);
      setData(prevData => [...prevData, ...newData]);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [page]);

  const loadMore = () => {
    setPage(prevPage => prevPage + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <View style={styles.item}>
            <Text>{item.key}</Text>
          </View>
        )}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.key}
        onEndReached={loadMore}
        onEndReachedThreshold={0.5}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
  },
  item: {
    padding: 10,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Expected Output:**
An application that handles a large list of items using pagination, ensuring efficient memory usage by loading only a subset of the data at a time.

### Task 19: Study Deployment Strategies for Mobile Apps

#### Explanation

**Understanding Deployment Strategies for Mobile Apps**

Deploying mobile applications involves several steps, from preparing the app for release to submitting it to app stores. For React Native applications, deployment includes building the app binaries, configuring app store metadata, and managing the release process. Key deployment strategies include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), version management, and over-the-air (OTA) updates. CI/CD pipelines automate the build and deployment process, ensuring that code changes are tested and deployed efficiently. Version management ensures that users receive updates without compatibility issues, while OTA updates allow for rapid distribution of updates without requiring users to download the app from the store again.

Effective deployment strategies improve the reliability and user experience of mobile applications. By automating the deployment process, developers can reduce the risk of human error and ensure that updates are delivered promptly. OTA updates, enabled by services like CodePush, allow developers to push updates directly to users' devices, bypassing the app store review process. This is particularly useful for minor updates and bug fixes. By understanding and implementing these strategies, developers can streamline their deployment workflows and deliver high-quality apps to users.

CodePush, a service provided by Microsoft, integrates with React Native to enable OTA updates. This is particularly useful for minor updates, bug fixes, and content changes, as it bypasses the app store review process and delivers updates instantly.

In this example, you will integrate CodePush into your React Native application to enable OTA updates. The setup involves installing the CodePush plugin, configuring the app, and deploying updates using the CodePush CLI.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Install necessary packages
// npm install react-native-code-push

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import codePush from 'react-native-code-push';

const App = () => {
  const handleSync = () => {
    codePush.sync({
      updateDialog: true,
      installMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE,
    });
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Welcome to CodePush Demo</Text>
      <Button title="Check for updates" onPress={handleSync} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});

export default codePush(App);
```
