```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const WS_URL = 'wss://echo.websocket.org';

function App() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [ws, setWs] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const wsInstance = new WebSocket(WS_URL);

    wsInstance.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
      setWs(wsInstance);
    };

    wsInstance.onmessage = (event) => {
      const newMessage = event.data;
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, { content: newMessage }]);
    };

    wsInstance.onclose = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
    };

    return () => {
      wsInstance.close();
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    if (ws && message.trim()) {
      ws.send(message);
      setMessage('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <FlatList
        data={messages}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.content}</Text>}
      />

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');
  const [ws, setWs] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const wsInstance = new WebSocket(WS_URL);

    wsInstance.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
      setWs(wsInstance);
    };

    wsInstance.onmessage = (event) => {
      setResponse(event.data);
    };

    wsInstance.onclose = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
    };

    return () => {
      wsInstance.close();
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    if (ws && message.trim()) {
      ws.send(message);
      setMessage('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        value={message}

    wsInstance.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
      setWs(wsInstance);
    };

    wsInstance.onmessage = (event) => {
      const newMessage = { content: event.data, fromServer: true };
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, newMessage]);
    };

    wsInstance.onclose = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
    };

    return () => {
      wsInstance.close();
    };

function App() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState('Disconnected');
  const wsRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    connectWebSocket();

    return () => {
      if (wsRef.current) {
        wsRef.current.close();
      }
    };
  }, []);

  const connectWebSocket = () => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL);

    ws.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
      setConnectionStatus('Connected');
      wsRef.current = ws;
    };

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const newMessage = { content: event.data, fromServer: true };
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, newMessage]);
    };

    ws.onclose = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
      setConnectionStatus('Disconnected');
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Attempting to reconnect...');
        connectWebSocket();
      }, 5000);
    };

    ws.onerror = (error) => {
      console.log('WebSocket error:', error.message);
      setConnectionStatus('Error');
    };
  };

  const sendMessage = () => {
    if (wsRef.current && message.trim()) {
      wsRef.current.send(message);
      const newMessage = { content: message, fromServer: false };
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, newMessage]);
      setMessage('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Text>Connection Status: {connectionStatus}</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={messages}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <Text style={{ color: item.fromServer ? 'blue' : 'black' }}>{item.content}</Text>
        )}

### Task 4: Integrate Video Streaming with HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)**:
HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is an adaptive bitrate streaming protocol developed by Apple for delivering video and audio content over the internet. HLS works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each representing a short segment of the overall content. As the client plays back the content, it continuously downloads these segments, allowing for adaptive bitrate streaming where the quality of the video can dynamically adjust based on the user's network conditions and device capabilities.

Integrating HLS into a React Native application allows developers to provide a seamless and adaptive video streaming experience. By leveraging HLS, applications can deliver high-quality video streams that automatically adjust to varying network conditions, ensuring smooth playback for users on both high-speed and slow internet connections. This is particularly important for cross-platform applications where users might access content from various devices and network environments.

### Example 2: Implementing HLS Video Playback with Custom Controls

#### Explanation

While `react-native-video` provides basic video playback controls, you might want to implement custom controls for a more tailored user experience. Custom controls can include play/pause buttons, volume control, and a progress bar. Implementing custom controls involves managing the video player's state and updating the UI based on user interactions.

In this example, we will enhance the HLS video playback by adding custom controls. We will manage the video player's state and create custom play/pause buttons, volume control, and a progress bar.

#### Code to Practice

1. Implement HLS video playback with custom controls:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, Slider, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';

const HLS_STREAM_URL = 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8';

function App() {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(true);
  const [volume, setVolume] = useState(1.0);
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  const handlePlayPause = () => {
    setPaused(!paused);
  };

  const handleVolumeChange = (value) => {
    setVolume(value);
  };

  const handleProgress = (data) => {
    setProgress(data.currentTime / data.playableDuration);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Video
        ref={videoRef}
        source={{ uri: HLS_STREAM_URL }}
        paused={paused}
        volume={volume}
        onProgress={handleProgress}
        controls={false}
        style={styles.video}
      />
      <Button title={paused ? 'Play' : 'Pause'} onPress={handlePlayPause} />
      <Slider
        style={styles.slider}
        value={volume}
        onValueChange={handleVolumeChange}
        minimumValue={0}
        maximumValue={1}
        step={0.1}
      />
      <View style={styles.progress}>
        <View style={{ flex: progress, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
        <View style={{ flex: 1 - progress, backgroundColor: 'gray' }} />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  video: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 300,
  },
  slider: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 40,
  },
  progress: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    height: 10,
    width: '100%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

### Example 3: Adaptive Bitrate Streaming with HLS

#### Explanation

Adaptive bitrate streaming with HLS involves delivering video content at multiple quality levels and dynamically adjusting the stream based on the user's network conditions. This ensures that users experience the best possible video quality without interruptions. Implementing adaptive bitrate streaming requires setting up an HLS stream with multiple bitrate variants and configuring the player to switch between them.

In this example, we will set up an adaptive bitrate HLS stream and integrate it into a React Native application. We will use `react-native-video` to play the stream and demonstrate how the player automatically adjusts the video quality based on network conditions.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up adaptive bitrate streaming with HLS:

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';

const ADAPTIVE_HLS_STREAM_URL = 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8';

function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Video
        source={{ uri: ADAPTIVE_HLS_STREAM_URL }}
        controls={true}
        style={{ width: '100%', height: 300 }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

### Task 5: Study Offline-First Design Principles for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**Offline-First Design Principles**:
Offline-first design is a paradigm that prioritizes the user experience when there is no network connectivity. The goal is to ensure that the application remains fully functional even when offline and synchronizes data with the server when connectivity is restored. This approach enhances the reliability and usability of applications, particularly in environments with intermittent or unreliable network connections. Implementing offline-first design involves using local storage, background synchronization, and conflict resolution strategies.

In React Native, offline-first design can be achieved through libraries and tools that support local data persistence and synchronization. Technologies like Redux Offline, SQLite, and service workers can help manage local storage and synchronize changes when the network is available. By adopting offline-first design principles, developers can create robust applications that provide a seamless user experience regardless of network conditions.

AsyncStorage is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It is often used as a local storage solution in React Native applications to save data that can be accessed even when the application is offline. Implementing local storage with AsyncStorage involves setting and retrieving data from the storage, ensuring that important user data is preserved across sessions and without network connectivity.

In this example, we will demonstrate how to use AsyncStorage to save and retrieve user preferences in a React Native application. This example will cover the basics of setting up local storage, saving data, and retrieving it when needed.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`:

```sh
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

2. Implement local storage with AsyncStorage:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [storedUsername, setStoredUsername] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const getUsername = async () => {
      const savedUsername = await AsyncStorage.getItem('username');
      if (savedUsername) {
        setStoredUsername(savedUsername);
      }
    };

    getUsername();
  }, []);

  const saveUsername = async () => {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('username', username);
    setStoredUsername(username);
    setUsername('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Save Username" onPress={saveUsername} />
      {storedUsername ? <Text>Stored Username: {storedUsername}</Text> : <Text>No username stored</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Example 2: Using Redux Offline for State Management

#### Explanation

Redux Offline is a library that enhances Redux to support offline-first architecture. It allows you to manage application state offline and sync it with the server when connectivity is restored. Redux Offline handles data persistence, background synchronization, and conflict resolution, making it an ideal choice for complex applications requiring robust offline capabilities.

In this example, we will integrate Redux Offline into a React Native application to manage state and synchronize data with a backend server. This example will demonstrate how to configure Redux Offline, manage offline state, and synchronize changes with the server when the network is available.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `redux`, `redux-offline`, and related dependencies:

```sh
npm install redux react-redux redux-offline
```

2. Set up Redux Offline for state management:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { offlineMiddleware, offlineConfig } from '@redux-offline/redux-offline';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';

// Actions
const SET_USERNAME = 'SET_USERNAME';

const setUsername = (username) => ({
  type: SET_USERNAME,
  payload: username,
});

// Reducer
const initialState = {
  username: '',
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_USERNAME:
      return { ...state, username: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(offlineMiddleware(offlineConfig)));

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <UsernameManager />
    </Provider>
  );
}

function UsernameManager() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const username = useSelector((state) => state.username);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const saveUsername = () => {
    dispatch(setUsername(inputValue));
    setInputValue('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter username"
        value={inputValue}
        onChangeText={setInputValue}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Save Username" onPress={saveUsername} />
      {username ? <Text>Stored Username: {username}</Text> : <Text>No username stored</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- Manages username state using Redux Offline and persists changes, ensuring data is synchronized with the server when connectivity is available.

### Example 3: Conflict Resolution and Data Synchronization

#### Explanation

Conflict resolution is a critical aspect of offline-first design, ensuring that data changes made offline are correctly synchronized with the server when connectivity is restored. Conflict resolution strategies can include last-write-wins, user-driven resolution, or merge algorithms. Proper conflict resolution ensures data consistency and integrity across multiple devices and users.

In this example, we will implement a simple conflict resolution strategy using Redux Offline. We will handle conflicts by allowing the latest update to overwrite previous ones. This demonstrates how to manage data conflicts and ensure synchronization in a React Native application.

#### Code to Practice

1. Implement conflict resolution and data synchronization:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { offlineMiddleware, offlineConfig } from '@redux-offline/redux-offline';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';

// Actions
const SET_USERNAME = 'SET_USERNAME';

const setUsername = (username) => ({
  type: SET_USERNAME,
  payload: username,
  meta: {
    offline: {
      effect: { url: '/update-username', method: 'POST', body: { username } },
      commit: { type: 'SET_USERNAME_COMMIT', meta: { username } },
      rollback: { type: 'SET_USERNAME_ROLLBACK', meta: { username } },
    },
  },
});

// Reducer
const initialState = {
  username: '',
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_USERNAME:
      return { ...state, username: action.payload };
    case 'SET_USERNAME_COMMIT':
      return { ...state, username: action.meta.username };
    case 'SET_USERNAME_ROLLBACK':
      return state;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(offlineMiddleware(offlineConfig)));

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <UsernameManager />
    </Provider>
  );
}

function UsernameManager() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const username = useSelector((state) => state.username);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const saveUsername = () => {
    dispatch(setUsername(inputValue));
    setInputValue('');
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter username"
        value={inputValue}
        onChangeText={setInputValue}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Save Username" onPress={saveUsername} />
      {username ? <Text>Stored Username: {username}</Text> : <Text>No username stored</Text>}
    </View>


  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- Manages username state with conflict resolution and synchronizes changes with the server, demonstrating conflict handling and data synchronization.

import SQLite from 'react-native-sqlite-storage';

SQLite.DEBUG(true);
SQLite.enablePromise(true);

const database_name = 'UserDatabase.db';
const database_version = '1.0';
const database_displayname = 'SQLite React Native Offline';
const database_size = 200000;

const db = SQLite.openDatabase(
  database_name,
  database_version,
  database_displayname,
  database_size,
  () => {
    console.log('Database opened');
  },
  (err) => {
    console.log('SQL Error: ' + err);
  }
);

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, Username TEXT);'
      );
    });

    fetchUsers();
  }, []);

  const fetchUsers = () => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM Users', [], (tx, results) => {
        const rows = results.rows;
        const usersList = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
          usersList.push(rows.item(i));
        }
        setUsers(usersList);
      });
    });
  };

  const saveUsername = () => {
    db.transaction((tx) => {
      tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO Users (Username) VALUES (?)', [username], (tx, results) => {
        if (results.rowsAffected > 0) {
          console.log('User added successfully');
          fetchUsers();
          setUsername('');
        } else {

### Example 3: Advanced Data Handling with Realm

#### Explanation

Realm is an object-oriented database that offers high performance and is easy to use with a straightforward API. It is designed specifically for mobile applications and supports complex queries and real-time updates. Using Realm in React Native allows developers to store and manage data in a more flexible and efficient manner, with features like live objects, thread safety, and easy data migrations.

In this example, we will use the `realm` library to set up advanced local storage in a React Native application. We will create a database schema, store user data, and demonstrate how to perform queries and updates efficiently.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `realm`:

```sh
npm install realm
npx pod-install
```

2. Implement advanced data handling with Realm:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import Realm from 'realm';

const UserSchema = {
  name: 'User',
  properties: {
    _id: 'int',
    username: 'string',
  },
  primaryKey: '_id',
};

const realm = new Realm({ schema: [UserSchema] });

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {

### Example 1: Implementing Secure Storage for Sensitive Data

#### Explanation

Storing sensitive data securely is a fundamental aspect of application security. This includes user credentials, authentication tokens, and personal information. React Native provides several options for secure storage, including the `react-native-keychain` library, which leverages the platform's secure storage mechanisms such as the iOS Keychain and Android Keystore. This ensures that sensitive data is stored in an encrypted format and protected against unauthorized access.

In this example, we will use the `react-native-keychain` library to securely store and retrieve user credentials in a React Native application. This demonstrates how to integrate secure storage into your app, providing an additional layer of protection for sensitive data.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `react-native-keychain`:

```sh
npm install react-native-keychain
npx pod-install
```

2. Implement secure storage for sensitive data:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [storedUsername, setStoredUsername] = useState('');
  const [storedPassword, setStoredPassword] = useState('');

  const saveCredentials = async () => {
    await Keychain.setGenericPassword(username, password);
    Alert.alert('Credentials saved securely!');
  };

  const retrieveCredentials = async () => {
    const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword();
    if (credentials) {
      setStoredUsername(credentials.username);
      setStoredPassword(credentials.password);
    } else {
      Alert.alert('No credentials stored');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Save Credentials" onPress={saveCredentials} />
      <Button title="Retrieve Credentials" onPress={retrieveCredentials} />
      {storedUsername && (
        <View>
          <Text>Stored Username: {storedUsername}</Text>
          <Text>Stored Password: {storedPassword}</Text>
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}

### Example 2: Using Encryption for Data Protection

#### Explanation

Encryption is a critical technique for protecting data both at rest and in transit. By encrypting sensitive data, you ensure that it cannot be easily read or tampered with if intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. In React Native, the `crypto-js` library provides a range of encryption algorithms, including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is widely used for its strength and efficiency.

In this example, we will use the `crypto-js` library to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data in a React Native application. This demonstrates how to protect data using strong encryption algorithms, enhancing the security of your application.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `crypto-js`:

```sh
npm install crypto-js
```

2. Implement data encryption and decryption:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';

const ENCRYPTION_KEY = 'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState('');
  const [encryptedData, setEncryptedData] = useState('');
  const [decryptedData, setDecryptedData] = useState('');

  const encryptData = (data) => {
    return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, ENCRYPTION_KEY).toString();
  };

  const decryptData = (encryptedData) => {
    const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, ENCRYPTION_KEY);
    return bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
  };

  const handleEncrypt = () => {
    const encrypted = encryptData(data);
    setEncryptedData(encrypted);
    Alert.alert('Data encrypted successfully!');
  };

  const handleDecrypt = () => {
    const decrypted = decryptData(encryptedData);
    setDecryptedData(decrypted);
    Alert.alert('Data decrypted successfully!');
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter data to encrypt"
        value={data}
        onChangeText={setData}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Encrypt Data" onPress={handleEncrypt} />
      {encryptedData && <Text>Encrypted Data: {encryptedData}</Text>}
      <Button title="Decrypt Data" onPress={handleDecrypt} />
      {decryptedData && <Text>Decrypted Data: {decryptedData}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

### Example 3: Implementing Secure Authentication and Authorization

#### Explanation

Secure authentication and authorization are essential for controlling access to your application and its resources. Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth, ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data and functionality. Additionally, using secure libraries and frameworks helps prevent common security vulnerabilities like token hijacking and session fixation.

In this example, we will implement secure authentication using JWT in a React Native application. This involves setting up user login, generating a JWT on successful authentication, and securely storing and using the token for subsequent requests.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a basic backend server (e.g., using Node.js and Express) to handle authentication and issue JWTs.
2. Implement secure authentication in React Native:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import axios from 'axios';

const SERVER_URL = 'https://your-backend-server.com';

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [token, setToken] = useState('');

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${SERVER_URL}/login`, { username, password });
      const { token } = response.data;
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('authToken', token);
      setToken(token);
      Alert.alert('Login successful!');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Login failed', error.message);
    }
  };

  const checkAuth = async () => {
    const storedToken = await AsyncStorage.getItem('authToken');
    if (storedToken) {
      setToken(storedToken);
      Alert.alert('User is authenticated');
    } else {
      Alert.alert('No authentication token found');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom:

 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />
      <Button title="Check Authentication" onPress={checkAuth} />
      {token && <Text>Authenticated with Token: {token}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Task 8: Implement Biometric Authentication for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**Biometric Authentication**:
Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify their identity. Common biometric methods include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and iris scanning. Biometric authentication provides a high level of security because it is difficult to replicate or forge. In mobile applications, integrating biometric authentication enhances security by adding an extra layer of protection for sensitive data and user accounts.

In React Native, biometric authentication can be implemented using libraries such as `react-native-fingerprint-scanner` or `react-native-touch-id`. These libraries provide access to the device's biometric authentication capabilities, allowing developers to prompt users for fingerprint or face recognition as part of the login or authentication process. This improves user convenience and security by eliminating the need for traditional passwords.

import FingerprintScanner from 'react-native-fingerprint-scanner';

function App() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      FingerprintScanner.release();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleAuthentication = () => {
    FingerprintScanner.authenticate({ description: 'Scan your fingerprint to authenticate' })
      .then(() => {
        setIsAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Authentication successful!');
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        Alert.alert('Authentication failed', error.message);
      });
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Authenticate with Fingerprint" onPress={handleAuthentication} />
      {isAuthenticated && <Text>Authenticated</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

### Example 2: Implementing Face Recognition Authentication

#### Explanation

Face recognition authentication uses the unique features of a user's face to verify their identity. It provides a convenient and secure way for users to access their accounts and sensitive information. In React Native, face recognition can be implemented using the `react-native-fingerprint-scanner` library, which also supports face recognition on devices that offer this feature.

In this example, we will implement face recognition authentication in a React Native application. We will use the `react-native-fingerprint-scanner` library to prompt the user for face recognition and handle the authentication process.

#### Code to Practice

1. Implement face recognition authentication:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import FingerprintScanner from 'react-native-fingerprint-scanner';

function App() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      FingerprintScanner.release();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleAuthentication = () => {
    FingerprintScanner.authenticate({ description: 'Scan your face to authenticate' })
      .then(() => {
        setIsAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Authentication successful!');
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        Alert.alert('Authentication failed', error.message);
      });
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Authenticate with Face Recognition" onPress={handleAuthentication} />

### Example 3: Fallback Mechanisms for Biometric Authentication

#### Explanation

Fallback mechanisms are essential for biometric authentication to ensure that users can still access their accounts if biometric verification fails or is unavailable. Common fallback methods include using PIN codes, passwords, or security questions. Implementing fallback mechanisms ensures that the application remains accessible and secure under various conditions.

In this example, we will implement a fallback mechanism using a PIN code for users who cannot authenticate with biometrics. This involves prompting the user for biometric authentication and, if it fails, allowing them to enter a PIN code to access the application.

#### Code to Practice

1. Implement fallback mechanism for biometric authentication:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import FingerprintScanner from 'react-native-fingerprint-scanner';

function App() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [pin, setPin] = useState('');
  const [enteredPin, setEnteredPin] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      FingerprintScanner.release();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleBiometricAuthentication = () => {
    FingerprintScanner.authenticate({ description: 'Scan your fingerprint to authenticate' })
      .then(() => {
        setIsAuthenticated(true);
        Alert.alert('Authentication successful!');
      })
      .catch(() => {
        Alert.alert('Biometric authentication failed. Please enter your PIN.');
      });
  };

  const handlePinAuthentication = () => {
    if (enteredPin === pin) {
      setIsAuthenticated(true);
      Alert.alert('Authentication successful!');
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Invalid PIN');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Set PIN"
        value={pin}
        onChangeText={setPin}
        secureTextEntry
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Authenticate with Fingerprint" onPress={handleBiometricAuthentication} />
      {!isAuthenticated && (
        <View>
          <TextInput
            placeholder="Enter PIN"
            value={enteredPin}
            onChangeText={setEnteredPin}
            secureTextEntry
            style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
          />
          <Button title="Authenticate with PIN" onPress={handlePinAuthentication} />
        </View>
      )}
      {isAuthenticated && <Text>Authenticated</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- Prompts the user for biometric authentication and falls back to PIN authentication if biometrics fail, ensuring access through an alternative method.

### Task 9: Study API Security Best Practices for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**API Security Best Practices**:
API security is crucial in modern applications as APIs are the backbone for communication between client-side applications and servers. Ensuring API security involves protecting the API endpoints from unauthorized access, securing data in transit, and implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes using HTTPS to encrypt data, employing API keys and tokens for authentication, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and validating all inputs to protect against injection attacks.

In React Native development, adhering to API security best practices is vital to protect sensitive user data and ensure the integrity of the application. By implementing these practices, developers can prevent common security vulnerabilities and build secure, reliable applications that are resilient against various attacks.

---

### Examples to Practice

1. **Implementing HTTPS for Secure Communication**
2. **Using JWT for Secure Authentication**
3. **Input Validation and Rate Limiting**

---

### Example 1: Implementing HTTPS for Secure Communication

#### Explanation

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the foundation of securing communication over the internet. It ensures that data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted, protecting it from interception and tampering. By using HTTPS, sensitive information such as login credentials and personal data are transmitted securely, significantly reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

In this example, we will configure a React Native application to communicate with an HTTPS-enabled server. This involves ensuring that all API requests are made over HTTPS and handling SSL certificates correctly.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up HTTPS in your server (e.g., using Express.js):

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/server.cert')
};

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a secure message.' });
});

https.createServer(options, app).listen(443, () => {
  console.log('HTTPS server running on port 443');
});
```

2. Configure React Native to make API requests over HTTPS:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'https://your-secure-server.com/api/data';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(API_URL);
        setData(response.data.message);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Text>Data from API: {data}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- Securely fetches data from an HTTPS-enabled API endpoint and displays it in the React Native application.

### Example 2: Using JWT for Secure Authentication

#### Explanation

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. They consist of a header, payload, and signature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the token. JWTs are particularly useful for stateless authentication, where the server does not need to store session data.

In this example, we will implement secure authentication using JWTs in a React Native application. This involves setting up a backend server to issue JWTs upon successful login, storing the JWT in the client, and using it for subsequent authenticated requests.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a backend server to issue JWTs (e.g., using Express.js and jsonwebtoken):

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

const users = [
  { id: 1, username: 'user1', password: 'password1' }
];

const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key';

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = users.find(u => u.username === username && u.password === password);

  if (user) {
    const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id, username: user.username }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});

app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];
  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
    res.json({ message: 'This is a protected message.', user: decoded });
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

2. Implement secure authentication in React Native:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const API_URL = 'https://your-secure-server.com';

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/login`, { username, password });
      const { token } = response.data;
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('authToken', token);
      Alert.alert('Login successful');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Login failed', error.message);
    }
  };

  const fetchProtectedData = async () => {
    try {
      const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('authToken');
      const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/protected`, {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
      });
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Failed to fetch data', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}

### Example 3: Input Validation and Rate Limiting

#### Explanation

Input validation is a critical aspect of API security, ensuring that all inputs are properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. Rate limiting is another essential practice that controls the number of requests a client can make to an API within a given timeframe. This helps prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, by limiting the impact of excessive or malicious requests.

In this example, we will implement input validation and rate limiting in a backend server using Express.js. This involves validating incoming data to ensure it meets expected criteria and using a rate-limiting middleware to control request rates.

#### Code to Practice

1. Implement input validation and rate limiting in a backend server (e.g., using Express.js):

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes)
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

app.use(limiter);

app.post(
  '/register',
  body('username').isAlphanumeric().

withMessage('Username must be alphanumeric'),
  body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email address'),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 6 }).withMessage('Password must be at least 6 characters long'),
  (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    const { username, email, password } = req.body;
    // Save user to database (pseudo code)
    // db.saveUser({ username, email, password });

    res.json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
  }
);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

2. Implement client-side registration in React Native:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'https://your-secure-server.com';

function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const register = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/register`, { username, email, password });
      Alert.alert('Registration successful', response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.response && error.response.data.errors) {
        const errors = error.response.data.errors.map((err) => err.msg).join('\n');
        Alert.alert('Registration failed', errors);
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Registration failed', error.message);
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Email"
        value={email}
        onChangeText={setEmail}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Register" onPress={register} />
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- Validates user input during registration and limits the number of requests from a single IP, demonstrating input validation and rate limiting.

### Task 10: Implement API Rate Limiting with Middleware for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**API Rate Limiting with Middleware**:
API rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of incoming requests to an API within a specific timeframe. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage among clients, protecting the API server from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. Rate limiting can be implemented using middleware, which intercepts incoming requests, counts them, and enforces limits based on predefined rules. Common methods for rate limiting include fixed window, sliding window, and token bucket algorithms.

In React Native applications, implementing API rate limiting is crucial to ensure that backend services remain responsive and performant. This is especially important for public APIs that might be accessed by a large number of users. Middleware solutions, such as `express-rate-limit` for Node.js, provide an easy way to integrate rate limiting into your backend services. By configuring rate limits, developers can prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensure a better user experience.

### Examples to Practice

1. **Setting Up Basic Rate Limiting with Express Middleware**
2. **Customizing Rate Limiting Rules**
3. **Implementing Advanced Rate Limiting with Redis**

### Example 1: Setting Up Basic Rate Limiting with Express Middleware

#### Explanation

Setting up basic rate limiting involves configuring middleware to enforce request limits for your API. This prevents clients from making too many requests in a short period, protecting your server from being overloaded. The `express-rate-limit` middleware is a popular choice for implementing rate limiting in Express.js applications. It allows you to define how many requests a client can make and within what timeframe.

In this example, we will set up a basic rate limiting middleware in an Express.js server. We will configure the middleware to allow a maximum of 100 requests per 15 minutes from a single IP address.

#### Code to Practice

1. Install `express-rate-limit`:

```sh
npm install express-rate-limit
```

2. Set up basic rate limiting in an Express server:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use(limiter);

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a rate-limited API endpoint.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

3. Implement the client-side in React Native to test rate limiting:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api/data';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(API_URL);
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error fetching data', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
      {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- The server limits each IP to 100 requests per 15 minutes, displaying a message if the limit is exceeded.

---

### Example 2: Customizing Rate Limiting Rules

#### Explanation

Customizing rate limiting rules allows you to tailor the rate limiting behavior to better suit the needs of your application. This includes setting different limits for different routes, handling burst traffic, and providing more informative responses to clients when limits are exceeded. The `express-rate-limit` middleware supports customization through various options and can be extended with custom logic.

In this example, we will customize the rate limiting rules to apply different limits for different API endpoints. We will set stricter limits for login routes to prevent brute-force attacks and more lenient limits for general data fetching routes.

#### Code to Practice

1. Customize rate limiting rules in an Express server:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();

const generalLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 200, // Limit each IP to 200 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // Limit each IP to 10 login attempts per windowMs
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/data', generalLimiter);
app.use('/api/login', loginLimiter);

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a general API endpoint.' });
});

app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Login attempt received.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

2. Implement the client-side in React Native to test customized rate limiting:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL_DATA = 'http://localhost:3000/api/data';
const API_URL_LOGIN = 'http://localhost:3000/api/login';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(API_URL_DATA);
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error fetching data', error.message);
    }
  };

  const login = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(API_URL_LOGIN, { username: 'user', password: 'pass' });
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error logging in', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={login} />
      {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- The server applies different rate limits to the login and general data endpoints, enforcing stricter limits on login attempts.

### Example 3: Implementing Advanced Rate Limiting with Redis

#### Explanation

Using Redis for rate limiting allows for more advanced and scalable rate limiting strategies, especially in distributed environments. Redis can store rate limit counters and expiry times, enabling consistent rate limiting across multiple instances of an application. This is particularly useful for high-traffic applications that need to scale horizontally.

In this example, we will implement advanced rate limiting using Redis with `express-rate-limit` and `redis`. This involves setting up a Redis instance, configuring the rate limiter to use Redis as the store, and integrating it into an Express server.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a Redis instance and install necessary packages:

```sh
npm install express-rate-limit redis connect-redis
```

2. Implement advanced rate limiting with Redis in an Express server:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const RedisStore = require('rate-limit-redis');
const redis = require('redis');
const app = express();

const redisClient = redis.createClient();

const limiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    sendCommand: (...args) => redisClient.call(...args),
  }),
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use(limiter);

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a rate-limited API endpoint.' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

3. Implement the client-side in React Native to test advanced rate limiting:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';


import { View, Text, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api/data';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(API_URL);
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error fetching data', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Fetch Data" onPress={fetchData} />
      {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output

- The server enforces rate limits using Redis, allowing for scalable and distributed rate limiting.

- Modify `index.js` or `App.js`:

```javascript
if (__DEV__) {
  import('react-native').then((ReactNative) => {
    const Flipper = require('react-native-flipper');
    Flipper.initializeReactNative(ReactNative);
  });
}
```

#### Expected Output

- Successfully integrates Flipper into the React Native project, enabling access to Flipper's debugging and profiling features.

Flipper's Network plugin allows you to inspect network requests made by your React Native application. It provides detailed information about each request, including URL, headers, request and response bodies, and status codes. This feature is invaluable for debugging API calls, monitoring network performance, and ensuring the correctness of data exchanges between the client and server.

In this example, we will use Flipper's Network plugin to inspect network requests in a React Native application. This involves making API calls from the app and viewing the details of these calls in Flipper to analyze their performance and correctness.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a sample React Native application with network requests:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const fetchData = async () => {

### Examples to Practice

1. **Identifying and Fixing Memory Leaks**
2. **Optimizing Component Renders**
3. **Using Flipper for Memory Profiling**

---

### Example 1: Identifying and Fixing Memory Leaks

#### Explanation

Memory leaks occur when allocated memory is not released after it is no longer needed, causing an app to consume more memory over time. Common sources of memory leaks in React Native include lingering event listeners, timers, and network requests. Identifying and fixing memory leaks is crucial to ensure efficient memory usage and prevent performance degradation.

In this example, we will create a sample React Native application with an intentional memory leak caused by an uncleaned timer. We will use Flipper to identify the memory leak and fix it by properly cleaning up the timer when the component unmounts.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a sample React Native application with a memory leak:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

function LeakyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Leaky interval');
    }, 1000);

    // No cleanup for the interval, causing a memory leak

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval); // Fixing the memory leak
    };
  }, []);

  return <Text>Leaky Component</Text>;
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Toggle Component" onPress={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)} />
      {show && <LeakyComponent />}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Identify and fix the memory leak using Flipper:

- Open Flipper and select your application.
- Go to the "Memory" plugin tab.
- Interact with the app by toggling the component and monitor the memory usage.
- Identify the memory leak and fix it by ensuring the timer is cleaned up in the `LeakyComponent`.

#### Expected Output

- Flipper identifies the memory leak caused by the uncleaned timer, and the memory usage stabilizes after fixing the leak.

### Example 2: Optimizing Component Renders

#### Explanation

Unnecessary component renders can lead to inefficient memory usage and poor performance. Optimizing component renders involves using techniques such as memoization, shouldComponentUpdate, and PureComponent to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This helps reduce the memory footprint and improves the overall performance of the application.

In this example, we will create a sample React Native application with a component that renders unnecessarily. We will optimize the component renders by using React's `memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary renders and improve performance.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a sample React Native application with unnecessary renders:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const generateItems = (count) => {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, (_, index) => ({ id: index.toString(), value: `Item ${index}` }));
};

const Item = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log('Rendering item:', value);
  return <Text>{value}</Text>;
});

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(generateItems(10));
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  const incrementCounter = () => {
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
  };

  const memoizedItems = useMemo(() => items, [items]);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Increment Counter" onPress={incrementCounter} />
      <Text>Counter: {counter}</Text>
      <FlatList
        data={memoizedItems}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Item value={item.value} />}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Optimize component renders:

- Use React's `memo` to memoize the `Item` component.
- Use `useMemo` to memoize the `items` array and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

#### Expected Output

- The `Item` component renders only when necessary, reducing the number of renders and improving performance.

### Task 14: Optimize Memory Usage with Garbage Collection for Cross-Platform Development using React Native

#### Explanation of the Topic

**Garbage Collection in React Native**:
Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management that reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer in use by the application. In JavaScript, garbage collection is handled by the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome), which periodically identifies and frees up memory that is no longer referenced by the application. This process helps prevent memory leaks and ensures that applications do not consume more memory than necessary.

In React Native, which uses JavaScript for the application logic, understanding garbage collection is crucial for optimizing memory usage. Developers need to ensure that objects and variables are correctly scoped and that unnecessary references are avoided. Proper management of event listeners, timers, and other resources is essential to allow the garbage collector to do its job efficiently. By following best practices and using tools to monitor memory usage, developers can significantly improve the performance and stability of their applications.

### Examples to Practice

1. **Managing Event Listeners and Timers**
2. **Using WeakMap and WeakSet for Memory Management**
3. **Profiling and Monitoring Memory Usage**

---

### Example 1: Managing Event Listeners and Timers

#### Explanation

Event listeners and timers are common sources of memory leaks in JavaScript applications. If not properly managed, they can prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming memory, leading to increased memory usage over time. It's essential to remove event listeners and clear timers when they are no longer needed to ensure efficient memory management.

In this example, we will create a React Native application that sets up event listeners and timers. We will then demonstrate how to properly clean up these resources to avoid memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a sample React Native application with event listeners and timers:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

function LeakyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      console.log('Window resized');
    };
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Interval running');
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Text>Leaky Component</Text>;
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Toggle Component" onPress={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)} />
      {show && <LeakyComponent />}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Properly manage event listeners and timers:

- Ensure event listeners and timers are cleaned up in the `useEffect` cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

#### Expected Output

- The application correctly manages memory by removing event listeners and clearing timers when the component unmounts.

### Example 2: Using WeakMap and WeakSet for Memory Management

#### Explanation

WeakMap and WeakSet are special types of collections in JavaScript that hold weak references to objects. Unlike Map and Set, the references in WeakMap and WeakSet do not prevent garbage collection. This makes them useful for storing metadata or temporary information about objects without affecting their garbage collection.

In this example, we will use WeakMap and WeakSet in a React Native application to manage memory more efficiently. We will demonstrate how to use these collections to store information without preventing garbage collection, helping to optimize memory usage.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up a sample React Native application using WeakMap and WeakSet:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const metadata = new WeakMap();

function LeakyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const obj = {};
    metadata.set(obj, { info: 'Some metadata' });

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Interval running');
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Text>Leaky Component</Text>;
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Button title="Toggle Component" onPress={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)} />
      {show && <LeakyComponent />}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

2. Manage memory efficiently with WeakMap:

- Use WeakMap to store metadata or temporary information without preventing garbage collection.

#### Expected Output

- The application uses WeakMap to manage memory efficiently, allowing objects to be garbage collected when no longer needed.

function App() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    try {
      await axios.post(API_URL, { email });
      Alert.alert('Email collected successfully!');
      setEmail('');
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Failed to collect email', error.message);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter your email"
        value={email}
        onChangeText={setEmail}
        style={{ borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1, marginBottom: 10 }}
      />
      <Button title="Submit" onPress={handleSubmit} />
    </View>
  );
}

```javascript
// server.js (Node.js + Express example)
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

let emails = [];

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/collect-email', (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  if (email) {
    emails.push(email);
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Email collected successfully' });
  } else {
    res.status(400).send({ message: 'Invalid email' });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

Firebase Cloud Functions allow you to run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. This makes it easy to send emails when certain actions occur in your app, such as user sign-ups or form submissions.

In this example, we will use Firebase Cloud Functions to send emails when a user submits their email address in the React Native app. We will set up a Firebase project, create a cloud function to send emails, and trigger this function from the app.

#### Code to Practice

1. Set up Firebase Cloud Functions:

- Install Firebase CLI:

```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init functions
```

2. Implement the email sending function using SendGrid:

```javascript
// functions/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

admin.initializeApp();
sgMail.setApiKey('YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY');

exports.sendWelcomeEmail = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: 'your-email@example.com',
    subject: 'Welcome!',
    text: 'Thank you for joining our app!',
    html: '<strong>Thank you for joining our app!</strong>',
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Email sent successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send({ message: 'Failed to send email', error });
  }
});
```

3. Update the React Native app to trigger the cloud function:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/sendWelcomeEmail';

In-app surveys are an effective way to collect structured feedback from users. SurveyMonkey provides tools to create and distribute surveys, making it easy to gather insights directly from your app users. Integrating SurveyMonkey in a React Native app allows you to prompt users to participate in surveys and collect valuable feedback for improving the app.

In this example, we will set up an in-app survey using SurveyMonkey. This includes creating a survey, embedding it in the app, and collecting responses from users.

#### Code to Practice

1. Create a survey on SurveyMonkey and get the survey URL.

2. Embed the survey in your app using a WebView:

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

function SurveyScreen() {
  return (
    <WebView
      source={{ uri: 'https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/your-survey-id' }}
      style={{ marginTop: 20 }}
    />
  );
}

function App() {
  const [showSurvey, setShowSurvey] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      {showSurvey ? (
        <SurveyScreen />
      ) : (
        <Button title="Take Survey" onPress={() => setShowSurvey(true)} />
      )}
    </View>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Expected Output
