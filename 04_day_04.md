### Task 4: Understand project structure

**Explanation:**
The project structure of a React application created with `create-react-app` consists of several key directories and files. The `src` directory contains your application's source code, including components, styles, and other assets. The `public` directory contains static assets like the `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point for the application.

Understanding the project structure helps you organize your code and follow best practices. The `src` directory typically includes files like `App.js` (the main application component), `index.js` (the entry point for JavaScript), and other component files. The `public` directory includes files that are publicly accessible, such as images and the HTML template.

**Resources:**
- [Create React App Documentation: Folder Structure](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure/)
- [JavaScript.info: Project Structure](https://javascript.info/project-structure)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
// src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example shows the content of `src/index.js`, which is the entry point for the JavaScript code in a React application. It imports React and ReactDOM, as well as the main `App` component and a CSS file. The `ReactDOM.render` method renders the `App` component into the DOM element with the ID `root`.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Welcome to My React App</h1>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example shows the content of `src/App.js`, which is the main application component. It imports React and a CSS file, and defines a functional component `App` that renders a header with a welcome message. The `App` component is then exported for use in other parts of the application.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [W3Schools: React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders the App component into the DOM element with ID 'root'
```
For Example 2:
```
Displays a header with the text "Welcome to My React App"
```

---

### Task 5: Learn about JSX syntax

**Explanation:**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of React components. JSX is transpiled to JavaScript by tools like Babel, converting HTML-like syntax into React function calls.

JSX provides a more intuitive way to define the UI, combining JavaScript logic with markup. It supports embedding expressions, using curly braces `{}` to include dynamic content or execute JavaScript code within the markup. Understanding JSX syntax is crucial for writing React components and building dynamic user interfaces.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Introducing JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- [MDN Web Docs: JSX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example shows a simple JSX element, `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`. The JSX syntax is similar to HTML, making it easy to understand and write. This element can be rendered in a React application to display a heading with the text "Hello, world!".

**Example 2:**
```javascript
const user = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {user.firstName} {user.lastName}!
  </h1>
);
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example shows how to embed JavaScript expressions within JSX. The `user` object contains `firstName` and `lastName` properties. The JSX element `<h1>` includes curly braces `{}` to embed the user's full name, dynamically generating the text "Hello, John Doe!".

For Example 1:
```
Renders an <h1> element with the text "Hello, world!"
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders an <h1> element with the text "Hello, John Doe!"
```

---

### Task 6: Create a simple component with JSX

**Explanation:**
Creating a simple component with JSX involves defining a function or class that returns JSX elements. Components are the building blocks of a React application, allowing you to encapsulate and reuse UI logic. JSX provides a straightforward way to define the structure and content of components.

A simple component can be created as a function that returns JSX. This component can then be used within other components or rendered directly in the DOM. Understanding how to create components with JSX is essential for building React applications.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [JavaScript.info: React Components](https://javascript.info/react-components)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a functional component `Welcome` that returns a JSX element. The component renders an `<h1>` element with the text "Welcome to My App". The `Welcome` component is then exported for use in other parts of the application.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a functional component `Greeting` that accepts `props` as an argument. The component returns an `<h1>` element with the text "Hello, {props.name}!". The `Greeting` component can be used to greet different users by passing different `name` props.

### Task 7: Study components and props

**Explanation:**
Components are the fundamental building blocks of a React application. They allow you to encapsulate UI logic and reuse it across your application. Components can be defined as functions or classes and can accept `props` (short for properties) to customize their behavior and appearance.

Props are read-only inputs passed to components from their parent. They allow you to pass data and event handlers to child components, enabling communication between different parts of your application. Understanding how to use components and props is crucial for building dynamic and reusable UIs in React.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [JavaScript.info: React Components](https://javascript.info/react-components)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function User(props) {
  return <h1>User: {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default User;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a functional component `User` that accepts `props` and returns an `<h1>` element displaying the user's name. The `props` object contains all the properties passed to the component, allowing it to render dynamic content based on the `name` prop.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Product(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>Price: ${props.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Product;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a functional component `Product` that accepts `props` and returns a JSX structure displaying the product's name and price. The `props` object contains the `name` and `price` properties, allowing the component to render dynamic content based on these props.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Props](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding React Props](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-react-props/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders an <h1> element with the text "User: [name]" where [name] is the value of the `name` prop passed to the component
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a <div> element containing an <h2> element with the product name and a <p> element with the product price
```

---

### Task 8: Pass props to components

**Explanation:**
Passing props to components involves providing data or event handlers to child components from their parent. Props are passed as attributes in JSX and can be accessed within the child component using the `props` object. This allows for dynamic and reusable components that can be customized based on the props they receive.

Props are essential for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React. They enable communication between components, allowing parent components to pass data and behavior to their children. Understanding how to pass and use props is crucial for building complex React applications.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [JavaScript.info: React Components](https://javascript.info/react-components)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import User from './User';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <User name="Alice" />
      <User name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an `App` component that renders two `User` components, each with a different `name` prop. The `User` component displays the user's name based on the `name` prop passed to it. The `App` component demonstrates how to pass props to child components.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Product from './Product';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Product name="Laptop" price="999.99" />
      <Product name="Smartphone" price="699.99" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an `App` component that renders two `Product` components, each with different `name` and `price` props. The `Product` component displays the product's name and price based on the props passed to it. The `App` component demonstrates how to pass multiple props to child components.

**Resources:**

### Task 9: Understand state and state management

**Explanation:**
State in React is an object that holds dynamic data that can change over time. Unlike props, which are read-only and passed from parent to child, state is managed within the component itself. State allows components to manage and render dynamic content based on user interactions, network requests, or other events.

State management involves keeping track of state changes and updating the component when the state changes. In functional components, state is managed using hooks like `useState`. In class components, state is managed using the `setState` method. Understanding state and state management is crucial for building interactive and responsive applications in React.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Component State](https://javascript.info/state)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Counter` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `count` state. The component renders a paragraph displaying the current count and a button to increment the count. The `setCount` function updates the `count` state, causing the component to re-render with the new count value.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The light is {isOn ? 'On' : 'Off'}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Toggle;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Toggle` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage an `isOn` state. The component renders a paragraph displaying whether the light is on or off, and a button to toggle the state. The `setIsOn` function updates the `isOn` state, causing the component to re-render with the new state.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React State](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding React State](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-react-state/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders a counter with a button that increments the count when clicked
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a toggle button that changes the text between "On" and "Off" when clicked
```

---

### Task 10: Use `useState` hook for state

**Explanation:**
The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state. The `useState` hook enables you to manage and update state within functional components, making them more dynamic and interactive.

Using the `useState` hook is straightforward. You call `useState` with an initial state value, and it returns the state value and the function to update it. You can then use these values in your component's JSX and event handlers to manage and update state as needed.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- [JavaScript.info: useState Hook](https://javascript.info/react-hooks#usestate-hook)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function NameForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default NameForm;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `NameForm` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `name` state. The component renders an input field for the user to enter their name and a paragraph that displays a greeting message with the entered name. The `setName` function updates the `name` state based on the input value.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ColorChanger() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red');

  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{ color }}>The current color is {color}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setColor('blue')}>Change to Blue</button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor('green')}>Change to Green</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ColorChanger;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `ColorChanger` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `color` state. The component renders a paragraph that displays the current color and buttons to change the color. The `setColor` function updates the `color` state based on the button clicked, causing the paragraph's text color to change.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React State Hook](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usestate.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: How to Use the useState Hook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-usestate-hook/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders an input field that updates a greeting message with the entered name
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a paragraph with buttons that change the text color when clicked
```

---

### Task 11: Create a component with state

**Explanation:**
Creating a component with state involves defining a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage state. The state can hold any type of data, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or objects. The component renders UI elements based on the current state and provides ways to update the state through event handlers.

Stateful components allow you to create interactive and dynamic UIs that respond to user input, network requests, and other events. By managing state within components, you can ensure that the UI stays in sync with the underlying data.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Using the State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Component State](https://javascript.info/state)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TemperatureConverter() {
  const [celsius, setCelsius] = useState(0);

  const fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={celsius}
        onChange={(e) => setCelsius(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>{celsius}°C is {fahrenheit}°F</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TemperatureConverter;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `TemperatureConverter` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `celsius` state. The component renders an input field for the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and a paragraph that displays the converted temperature in Fahrenheit. The `setCelsius` function updates the `celsius` state based on the input value.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TaskList() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const addTask = (task) => {
    setTasks([...tasks, task]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        onKeyDown={(e) => {
          if (e.key === 'Enter') {
            addTask(e.target.value);
            e.target.value = '';
          }
        }}
      />
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{task}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TaskList;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `TaskList` component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `tasks` state, which is an array of task strings. The component renders an input field for the user to enter tasks and a list of tasks. The `addTask` function adds a new task to the `tasks` state when the user presses the Enter key.

### Task 12: Learn about event handling in React

**Explanation:**
Event handling in React is similar to handling events in regular HTML and JavaScript, but with some key differences. In React, events are named using camelCase (e.g.,

 `onClick` instead of `onclick`) and are passed as functions rather than strings. Event handlers in React can be defined as inline functions or as methods within a component.

React's synthetic event system ensures that events behave consistently across different browsers. Understanding how to handle events in React allows you to create interactive components that respond to user actions, such as clicks, form submissions, and key presses.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Event Handling](https://javascript.info/events)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Button() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

export default Button;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Button` component that handles a click event. The `handleClick` function displays an alert when the button is clicked. The `onClick` event handler is attached to the button element, triggering the `handleClick` function when the button is clicked.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function InputField() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Current value: {value}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default InputField;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines an `InputField` component that handles a change event. The `handleChange` function updates the `value` state based on the input field's value. The `onChange` event handler is attached to the input element, triggering the `handleChange` function when the input value changes.

### Task 13: Handle events in components

**Explanation:**
Handling events in components involves defining event handler functions and attaching them to elements using event attributes like `onClick`, `onChange`, and `onSubmit`. Event handlers can be inline functions or methods defined within the component. Handling events allows you to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.

In React, event handlers receive an event object that provides information about the event, such as the target element and the type of event. By handling events, you can update the component's state, perform actions, and trigger side effects in response to user interactions.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Event Handling](https://javascript.info/events)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Form() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted value: ${inputValue}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Form` component that handles a submit event. The `handleSubmit` function prevents the default form submission behavior and displays an alert with the submitted value. The form's `onSubmit` event handler triggers the `handleSubmit` function, and the input's `onChange` event handler updates the `inputValue` state.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function HoverBox() {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
      style={{
        width: '100px',
        height: '100px',
        backgroundColor: isHovered ? 'blue' : 'gray',
      }}
    >
      Hover over me
    </div>
  );
}

export default HoverBox;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `HoverBox` component that handles mouse enter and leave events. The component updates the `isHovered` state based on the mouse position. The `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers trigger functions that update the `isHovered` state, changing the box's background color.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Events](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_events.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Handling Events in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/handling-events-in-react/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Displays an alert with the submitted value when the form is submitted
```
For Example 2:
```
Changes the box's background color based on the hover state
```

### Task 14: Study conditional rendering

**Explanation:**
Conditional rendering in React allows you to render different UI elements or components based on certain conditions. This is achieved using JavaScript conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and ternary operators within JSX. Conditional rendering enables you to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that adapt to different states and user actions.

In React, you can conditionally render elements by embedding JavaScript expressions within JSX. These expressions evaluate to true or false, determining which elements are rendered. Understanding conditional rendering is crucial for building interactive and user-friendly applications.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Conditional Rendering](https://javascript.info/react-conditional-rendering)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in</h1>}
      <button onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(!isLoggedIn)}>
        {isLoggedIn ? 'Logout' : 'Login'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Greeting` component that uses conditional rendering to display different messages based on the `isLoggedIn` state. If the user is logged in, the component displays "Welcome back!" and a logout button. Otherwise, it displays "Please sign in" and a login button. The button's `onClick` event handler toggles the `isLoggedIn` state.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Message() {
  const [showMessage, setShowMessage] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      {showMessage && <p>This is a conditional message</p>}
      <button onClick={() => setShowMessage(!showMessage)}>
        {showMessage ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Message;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Message` component that uses conditional rendering to show or hide a message based on the `showMessage` state. If `showMessage` is true, the component displays a paragraph with a message and a button to hide it. If `showMessage` is false, the button text changes to "Show", and the message is hidden.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Conditional Rendering](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_conditional_rendering.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Conditional Rendering in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/conditional-rendering-in-react/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Displays a welcome message or sign-in prompt based on the login state
```
For Example 2:
```
Shows or hides a message based on the showMessage state
```

### Task 15: Implement conditional rendering

**Explanation:**
Implementing conditional rendering involves using JavaScript conditional statements within JSX to control which elements or components are rendered based on certain conditions. This technique allows you to create dynamic UIs that adapt to different states, user actions, and data.

Conditional rendering can be achieved using `if` statements, ternary operators, logical `&&` operators, and other JavaScript expressions. By conditionally rendering elements, you can provide a more interactive and personalized user experience.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Conditional Rendering](https://javascript.info/react-conditional-rendering)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Notification() {
  const [hasUnreadMessages, setHasUnreadMessages] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {hasUnreadMessages ? (
        <p>You have unread messages</p>
      ) : (
        <p>No

 new messages</p>
      )}
      <button onClick={() => setHasUnreadMessages(!hasUnreadMessages)}>
        Toggle Message Status
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Notification;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Notification` component that uses conditional rendering to display different messages based on the `hasUnreadMessages` state. If there are unread messages, the component displays "You have unread messages" and a button to toggle the message status. If there are no unread messages, it displays "No new messages".

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function UserProfile() {
  const [isAdmin, setIsAdmin] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      {isAdmin ? (
        <p>Welcome, Admin!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Welcome, User!</p>
      )}
      <button onClick={() => setIsAdmin(!isAdmin)}>
        {isAdmin ? 'Revoke Admin' : 'Grant Admin'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `UserProfile` component that uses conditional rendering to display different messages based on the `isAdmin` state. If the user is an admin, the component displays "Welcome, Admin!" and a button to revoke admin status. If the user is not an admin, it displays "Welcome, User!" and a button to grant admin status.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Conditional Rendering](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_conditional_rendering.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Conditional Rendering in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/conditional-rendering-in-react/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Displays a message about unread messages based on the hasUnreadMessages state
```
For Example 2:
```
Displays a user or admin welcome message based on the isAdmin state
```

### Task 16: Learn about lists and keys

**Explanation:**
Rendering lists in React involves mapping over an array of data and returning a list of elements. Each element in the list should have a unique `key` prop to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. Keys improve the efficiency of updates and ensure that elements are rendered correctly.

Keys should be unique and stable, typically using unique identifiers from the data being rendered. If no unique identifier is available, the array index can be used as a last resort. Understanding lists and keys is essential for rendering dynamic collections of data in React.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Rendering Lists](https://javascript.info/react-lists-keys)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

export default NumberList;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `NumberList` component that receives an array of numbers as a prop and renders a list of list items. Each list item is given a unique `key` prop based on the number value. The `key` prop helps React efficiently update the list when changes occur.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function TodoList(props) {
  const todos = props.todos;
  const listItems = todos.map((todo) =>
    <li key={todo.id}>
      {todo.text}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

export default TodoList;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `TodoList` component that receives an array of todo objects as a prop and renders a list of list items. Each list item is given a unique `key` prop based on the todo's `id`. The `key` prop helps React efficiently update the list when changes occur.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Lists and Keys](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lists.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding React Lists and Keys](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-react-lists-and-keys/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders a list of numbers with unique keys based on the number value
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a list of todo items with unique keys based on the todo ID
```

---

### Task 17: Render a list of items

**Explanation:**
Rendering a list of items in React involves iterating over an array of data and returning a list of elements. The `map` method is commonly used to iterate over the array and create a new array of elements. Each element in the list should have a unique `key` prop to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.

Rendering lists allows you to dynamically display collections of data, such as lists of users, products, or messages. By using keys, you ensure that React efficiently updates the list and maintains the correct order of elements.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- [JavaScript.info: Rendering Lists](https://javascript.info/react-lists-keys)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function FruitList() {
  const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default FruitList;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `FruitList` component that renders a list of fruit names. The `map` method iterates over the `fruits` array and returns a list of list items. Each list item is given a unique `key` prop based on the array index, which helps React efficiently update the list.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function ContactList() {
  const contacts = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Alice Johnson' }
  ];

  return (
    <ul>
      {contacts.map((contact) => (
        <li key={contact.id}>{contact.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default ContactList;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `ContactList` component that renders a list of contact names. The `map` method iterates over the `contacts` array and returns a list of list items. Each list item is given a unique `key` prop based on the contact's `id`, which helps React efficiently update the list.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Lists and Keys](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lists.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding React Lists and Keys](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-react-lists-and-keys/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders a list of fruit names with unique keys based on the array index
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a list of contact names with unique keys based on the contact ID
```

### Task 18: Study component lifecycle methods

**Explanation:**
Component lifecycle methods in React allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. These methods provide hooks for running side effects, performing cleanup, and interacting with external resources.

In class components, lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. In functional components, hooks like `useEffect` provide similar functionality. Understanding lifecycle methods is crucial for managing side effects and ensuring components behave correctly throughout their lifecycle.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Class Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
- [JavaScript.info: Component Lifecycle](https://javascript.info/react-component-lifecycle)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Timer extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      seconds: state.seconds + 1
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</div>;
  }
}

export default Timer;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Timer` class component that uses lifecycle methods to manage a timer. The `componentDidMount` method sets up an interval that updates the `seconds` state every second. The `componentWillUnmount` method clears the interval when the component is unmounted. The `tick` method updates the `seconds` state, and the `render` method displays the current seconds.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, set

Seconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds((seconds) => seconds + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}

export default Timer;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Timer` functional component that uses the `useEffect` hook to manage a timer. The `useEffect` hook sets up an interval that updates the `seconds` state every second. The cleanup function returned by `useEffect` clears the interval when the component is unmounted. The component renders the current seconds.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Component Lifecycle](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Understanding React Component Lifecycle](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-component-lifecycle/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders a timer that updates the seconds count every second
```
For Example 2:
```
Renders a timer that updates the seconds count every second
```

### Task 19: Understand hooks basics

**Explanation:**
Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks include `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for handling side effects, and `useContext` for accessing context. Hooks provide a way to reuse stateful logic without changing the component hierarchy.

Hooks follow specific rules, such as only being called at the top level of a component and not being used conditionally. Understanding the basics of hooks is essential for writing modern React applications and leveraging the full power of functional components.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [JavaScript.info: React Hooks](https://javascript.info/react-hooks)

**Example 1:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `Counter` functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `count` state. The component renders a paragraph displaying the current count and a button to increment the count. The `setCount` function updates the `count` state, causing the component to re-render with the new count value.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function FetchData() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default FetchData;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `FetchData` functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage a `data` state and the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API. The `useEffect` hook fetches data when the component mounts and updates the `data` state with the fetched data. The component renders the data title or a loading message based on the `data` state.

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools: React Hooks](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_hooks.asp)
- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to React Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-react-hooks/)

**Expected Output:**
For Example 1:
```
Renders a counter with a button that increments the count when clicked
```
For Example 2:
```
Fetches data from an API and displays the data title or a loading message
```

### Task 20: Review and build a small component-based project

**Explanation:**
Building a small component-based project involves using the concepts and skills learned in previous tasks to create a complete React application. This project should include multiple components, state management, event handling, conditional rendering, lists, and keys. The goal is to apply your knowledge in a practical context and create a functional and interactive application.

Reviewing and building a project helps solidify your understanding of React concepts and provides hands-on experience. It also allows you to practice organizing and structuring your code, managing component state, and handling user interactions.

**Resources:**
- [React Official Documentation: Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- [JavaScript.info: React Project](https://javascript.info/react-getting-started)

**Example Project:**
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TodoApp() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const addTodo = () => {
    setTodos([...todos, { id: todos.length, text: inputValue }]);
    setInputValue('');
  };

  const removeTodo = (id) => {
    setTodos(todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.text}
            <button onClick={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoApp;
```

**Example Explanation:**
This example defines a `TodoApp` component that manages a list of todo items. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `todos` and `inputValue` states. The `addTodo` function adds a new todo to the list, and the `removeTodo` function removes a todo from the list. The component renders an input field, a button to add todos, and a list of todos with remove buttons.

**Project Breakdown:**
- **Components:** The project uses functional components to create a todo list application.
- **State Management:** The `useState` hook manages the state for todos and the input value.
- **Event Handling:** The project handles input changes and button clicks to add and remove todos.
- **Conditional Rendering:** The project conditionally renders the list of todos and the remove buttons.
- **Lists and Keys:** The project renders a list of todos with unique keys based on the todo ID.
