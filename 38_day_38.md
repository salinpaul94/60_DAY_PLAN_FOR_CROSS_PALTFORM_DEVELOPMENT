### Task 1: Review and refactor project code

**Explanation:**
Reviewing and refactoring project code involves examining your existing codebase to identify areas for improvement. This can include cleaning up code, optimizing performance, improving readability, and ensuring adherence to coding standards. Refactoring helps reduce technical debt, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

Refactoring is crucial for long-term project health. It allows developers to address code smells, improve the structure of the code without changing its behavior, and make future development more efficient. Regular code reviews and refactoring ensure that the code remains clean, maintainable, and scalable.

**Resources:**
- [Refactoring Techniques](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
- [Code Review Best Practices](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/code-reviews/best-practices)

**Example 1: Refactoring a Large Function into Smaller Functions**
Identify a large function in your project and refactor it into smaller, more manageable functions. This improves readability and maintainability.

**Example Explanation:**
Refactoring a large function involves breaking it down into smaller functions that each handle a specific task. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

**Example 2: Improving Code Readability with Descriptive Variable Names**
Review your code to replace ambiguous variable names with more descriptive ones. This enhances code readability and makes it easier for others to understand the purpose of each variable.

**Example Explanation:**
Using descriptive variable names involves renaming variables to more clearly describe their role or content. This improves readability and reduces the cognitive load on developers reading the code.

**Resources:**
- [Refactoring Techniques](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
- [Code Review Best Practices](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/code-reviews/best-practices)

**Expected Output:**
For Refactoring a Large Function into Smaller Functions:
```sh
# Identify and refactor a large function in your project into smaller functions
```
```js
// Before refactoring
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  calculateTotal(order);
  applyDiscount(order);
  updateInventory(order);
  sendConfirmationEmail(order);
}

// After refactoring
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  calculateTotal(order);
  applyDiscount(order);
  updateInventory(order);
  sendConfirmationEmail(order);
}

function validateOrder(order) {
  // validation logic
}

function calculateTotal(order) {
  // total calculation logic
}

function applyDiscount(order) {
  // discount application logic
}

function updateInventory(order) {
  // inventory update logic
}

function sendConfirmationEmail(order) {
  // email sending logic
}
```
Output: Refactors a large function into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.

For Improving Code Readability with Descriptive Variable Names:
```sh
# Review and improve variable names for better readability
```
```js
// Before refactoring
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

// After refactoring
let firstNumber = 10;
let secondNumber = 20;
let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
```
Output: Improves code readability by using descriptive variable names.

      Footer.js
    /screens
      HomeScreen.js
      DetailsScreen.js
    /utils
      api.js
      helpers.js
    /styles
      colors.js
      typography.js
```
Output: Adopts a consistent project structure to improve code organization and maintainability.

For Using Functional Components and Hooks:
```sh
# Prefer functional components and hooks over class components
```
```js
// Before refactoring (class component)
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// After refactoring (functional component with hooks)
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {

Output: Sets up a WebSocket server to handle real-time messaging between clients.

For Creating a WebSocket Client:
```sh
# Create a WebSocket client to connect to the server and send/receive messages
```
```js
// App.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, event.data]);
    };
  }, [socket]);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.send(input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Real-Time Chat with WebSockets</h1>
      <div>
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <p key={index}>{msg}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
      <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Output: Creates a WebSocket client to connect to the server and send/receive real-time messages, enabling a chat feature.
