#### Task 2: State Management with Zustand
**Explanation:**
Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React applications. It provides a simple API for managing state outside of the React component tree, which can be especially useful for managing global state or state that needs to be shared across multiple components. Zustand uses hooks to manage state, making it easy to integrate with functional components.

Using Zustand involves creating a store to hold your state and defining actions to update the state. You can then use hooks to access and update the state from within your React components. Zustand provides a minimalistic approach to state management, making it a good alternative to more complex solutions like Redux.

    if (req.method === 'GET') {
        await client.connect();
        const collection = client.db('test').collection('users');
        const users = await collection.find({}).toArray();
        res.status(200).json(users);
    } else if (req.method === 'POST') {
        const { name, email } = req.body;
        await client.connect();
        const collection = client.db('test').collection('users');
        await collection.insertOne({ name, email });
        res.status(201).json({ message: 'User added' });
    } else {
        res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
    }
}

// Expected Output: An API endpoint that handles GET and POST requests to interact with a MongoDB database.

#### Task 8: Redux Toolkit
**Explanation:**
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools and best practices to simplify Redux development, including a powerful `createSlice` function for creating reducers and actions, a `configureStore` function for setting up the store, and built-in support for middleware and asynchronous actions.

Using Redux Toolkit involves setting up the store with `configureStore`, creating slices with `createSlice` to manage state and actions, and integrating Redux with your React components using the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks. This approach simplifies Redux development and ensures that your state management is efficient and maintainable.

#### Task 11: Performance Optimization with React.memo
**Explanation:**
React.memo is a higher-order component that optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of functional components. It memoizes the result of a component's render, and only re-renders the component if its props change. This optimization can significantly improve performance, especially for components that are expensive to render or are rendered frequently.

Using React.memo involves wrapping your functional components with the React.memo function, providing a way to customize the comparison of props using a custom equality function. This approach ensures that your components are only re-rendered when necessary, improving the efficiency of your application.

**Online Resources:**
