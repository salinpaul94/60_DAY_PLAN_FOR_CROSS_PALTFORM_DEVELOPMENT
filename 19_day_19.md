### Task 1: Study deployment strategies

**Explanation:**
Deployment strategies refer to the methods and processes used to release software applications to production environments. In mobile app development, deployment strategies ensure that applications are delivered efficiently and reliably to users through app stores or direct downloads. Common strategies include continuous deployment, blue-green deployment, canary releases, and rolling updates. These strategies help minimize downtime, reduce deployment risks, and ensure smooth rollouts.

Understanding deployment strategies is crucial for developers to effectively manage the release process and maintain high availability and reliability of their applications. By implementing appropriate deployment strategies, developers can ensure that updates and new features reach users without causing disruptions or service outages.

**Resources:**
- [Deployment Strategies for Mobile Apps](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/mobile-app-deployment-strategies/)
- [Continuous Delivery and Deployment Strategies](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousDelivery.html)

**Example 1: Blue-Green Deployment**
Blue-green deployment involves maintaining two identical environments (blue and green). At any given time, only one environment (say, blue) serves the live production traffic, while the other (green) is idle. When deploying a new version, it is released to the idle environment (green). Once the deployment is successful and tested, traffic is switched to the green environment, making it live.

**Example Explanation:**
This strategy minimizes downtime and ensures that a stable environment is always available. If any issues occur with the new version, traffic can be switched back to the blue environment, ensuring minimal impact on users.

**Example 2: Canary Releases**
Canary releases involve rolling out a new version of the application to a small subset of users first. This approach allows developers to monitor the new version for any issues in a controlled manner. If no issues are detected, the rollout can continue to a larger user base.

**Example Explanation:**
Canary releases help in identifying potential problems early, reducing the risk of widespread issues. It ensures that only a small percentage of users are affected if there are any bugs or performance issues in the new version.

**Resources:**
- [Blue-Green Deployment](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment)
- [Canary Releases](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html)

**Expected Output:**
For Blue-Green Deployment:
```
Ensures minimal downtime and allows for quick rollback if any issues occur with the new version.
```
For Canary Releases:
```
Identifies potential issues early by rolling out to a small subset of users before a full release.
```

### Task 10: Study app versioning

**Explanation:**
App versioning involves managing the version numbers of an application to keep track of changes, updates, and improvements. Versioning is crucial for maintaining compatibility, ensuring users receive the latest features and bug fixes, and facilitating rollback if necessary. Common versioning schemes include Semantic Versioning (semver), where version numbers are structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

Understanding app versioning is essential for developers to effectively manage the release process and maintain compatibility across different versions of the application. It ensures that users receive updates in a structured and predictable manner.

**Resources:**
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Versioning Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning)

**Example 1: Semantic Versioning (semver)**
Semantic Versioning uses the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. A MAJOR version change indicates incompatible API changes, a MINOR version change adds functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and a PATCH version change includes backward-compatible bug fixes.

**Example Explanation:**
Using semantic versioning helps developers and users understand the scope of changes in each release. It provides a clear and structured way to manage version numbers and ensures compatibility.

**Example 2: Versioning in Android**
In Android, versioning involves setting the `versionCode` and `versionName` in the `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 2
        versionName "1.1.0"
    }
}
```

**Example Explanation:**
Setting the `versionCode` and `versionName` ensures that the app's version information is correctly displayed to users and used by the Google Play Store to manage updates and compatibility.
