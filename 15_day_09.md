#### Task 2: API Security with JWT
**Explanation:**
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, providing a secure way to exchange information between the client and server. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature, which are encoded and concatenated to form the token.

Using JWTs for API security involves generating tokens upon successful user authentication, sending the tokens to clients, and validating them on subsequent requests. This approach ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources, enhancing the security of your application.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JWT Documentation](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
2. [JWT in Node.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-jwt-expressjs)

**Example 1: Generating JWTs in Node.js**
1. **Installing JWT Library:** Install the `jsonwebtoken` library in your Node.js project.
2. **Creating and Sending Tokens:** Generate JWTs upon successful user authentication and send them to the client.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Installing the `jsonwebtoken` library provides the tools necessary to generate and verify JWTs in your Node.js application. Creating and sending tokens upon successful authentication ensures that clients receive a token to use for accessing protected resources.

**Example 2: Validating JWTs in Node.js**
1. **Middleware for Token Validation:** Implement middleware to validate JWTs on incoming requests.
2. **Protecting Routes:** Use the middleware to protect specific routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Implementing middleware for token validation ensures that incoming requests are authenticated before accessing protected resources. Using the middleware to protect routes provides a secure way to control access to sensitive parts of your application.

**Online Resources:**
1. [JWT Authentication in Node.js](https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/secure-rest-api-in-nodejs)
2. [JWT Middleware in Express](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-authenticate-using-jwt-and-passport/)

**Code and Expected Output:**
```sh
# Installing JWT Library
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

```js
# Generating JWTs in Node.js
# auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const user = { id: 1, username: 'user' };
    const token = jwt.sign(user, 'secretkey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

# Expected Output: A server that generates and sends JWTs upon successful login.
```

```js
# Validating JWTs in Node.js
# auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!token) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'No token provided' });

    jwt.verify(token, 'secretkey', (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to authenticate token' });
        req.userId = decoded.id;
        next();
    });
};

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const user = { id: 1, username: 'user' };
    const token = jwt.sign(user, 'secretkey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
});

app.get('/protected', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'This is a protected route' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

# Expected Output: A server with JWT validation middleware that protects routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.

#### Task 6: State Management with Redux
**Explanation:**
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, providing a single source of truth for the application state. It helps manage the state in a predictable and centralized manner, making it easier to debug and maintain complex applications. Redux follows three core principles: a single source of truth, state is read-only, and changes are made with pure functions.

Using Redux involves creating actions to describe state changes, reducers to handle these actions and update the state, and a store to hold the application state. This approach ensures that your application's state is managed consistently and predictably, providing a robust foundation for building scalable applications.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/)
2. [Getting Started with Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

**Example 1: Setting Up Redux in a React Application**
1. **Installing Redux and React-Redux:** Install the necessary libraries to integrate Redux with a React application.
2. **Creating a Redux Store:** Create a Redux store to hold the application state and integrate it with the React application.

**Explanation for Example 1:**
Installing Redux and React-Redux provides the tools needed to integrate Redux with a React application. Creating a Redux store involves setting up the store to hold the application state and integrating it with the React application using the `Provider` component.

**Example 2: Implementing Actions and Reducers**
1. **Creating Actions and Action Creators:** Define actions and action creators to describe state changes.
2. **Creating Reducers:** Implement reducers to handle actions and update the state accordingly.

**Explanation for Example 2:**
Creating actions and action creators involves defining the actions that describe state changes and functions that return these actions. Implementing reducers ensures that the application state is updated predictably in response to actions, providing a consistent and reliable state management solution.

**Online Resources:**
1. [Redux Actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions)
2. [Redux Reducers](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers)

# Installing Redux and React-Redux
npm install redux react-redux
```

```js
# Setting Up Redux in a React Application
# index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);

# Expected Output: A React application with Redux integrated, using a Redux store to manage the application state.
```

```js
# Implementing Actions and Reducers

    count: 0
};

const counter = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return {
                ...state,
                count: state.count + 1
            };
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return {
                ...state,
                count: state.count - 1
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

export default counter;

# Expected Output: Actions and reducers implemented to handle state changes in a Redux store.
