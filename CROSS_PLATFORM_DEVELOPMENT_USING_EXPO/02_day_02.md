### Task 1: Read React Native documentation on basic components

- **Explanation 1**: React Native provides essential building blocks called components, which are analogous to HTML elements but designed for mobile applications. These components, such as `View`, `Text`, and `Image`, are designed to create the UI and are optimized for mobile devices. They come with specific attributes, behaviors, and properties that allow developers to build complex UIs using simple constructs.
- **Explanation 2**: Understanding these basic components is fundamental when developing apps with React Native because they allow you to create the structure and layout of your mobile app. Each component has different properties, and their behavior can be customized to fit the app's design. By referring to the official documentation, you’ll understand how these components work, how to style them, and how they are rendered on both iOS and Android platforms.

#### Online Resources
1. [React Native Components Overview](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)
2. [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

#### Examples to Practice
1. **Example 1**: Create a simple `View` component containing a `Text` component.
    - **Explanation**: This is a basic setup where the `View` component acts as a container for the `Text` component. The `View` is the parent component that holds and organizes child components, while the `Text` component displays textual content.
    - **Explanation**: This exercise helps you understand how React Native renders basic components and how they can be nested. It introduces you to fundamental concepts such as component hierarchy and layout.

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <View>
          <Text>Hello World!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default App;
    ```

    - **Expected Output**: The app should display the text "Hello World!" centered within a basic `View` layout.

2. **Example 2**: Create a `View` component with multiple `Text` components, each styled differently.
    - **Explanation**: This example introduces the concept of multiple `Text` components within the same `View`. Each `Text` component can have its unique style to show how styling works in React Native.
    - **Explanation**: This helps in understanding how styling is applied to components using `StyleSheet`. You will see how different styles can be applied to different components within the same `View`.

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.text1}>Hello, World!</Text>
          <Text style={styles.text2}>Welcome to React Native</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        padding: 10,
      },
      text1: {
        fontSize: 24,
        color: 'blue',
      },
      text2: {
        fontSize: 18,
        color: 'green',
      },
    });

    export default App;
    ```

    - **Expected Output**: The app will display two lines of text: "Hello, World!" in blue and "Welcome to React Native" in green.

          <Text>Hello from a Function Component!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default Greeting;
    ```

    - **Expected Output**: The screen will display the message: "Hello from a Function Component!"

2. **Example 2**: Create a function component that takes a prop and displays a personalized message.
    - **Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to pass data (props) to a function component. The `Greeting` component will accept a `name` prop and display a custom greeting.
    - **Explanation**: This is useful when building reusable components, as it shows how you can pass data dynamically to components to modify their behavior or display.

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

    const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
      return (
        <View>
          <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    const App = () => {
      return <Greeting name="John Doe" />;
    };

#### Examples to Practice
1. **Example 1**: Replace the default `App` component with a `Greeting` component.
    - **Explanation**: This simple task will introduce you to the practice of organizing components into separate files and importing them into the main `App.js` file. The `Greeting` component will replace the default one, and the app will render the custom message.
    - **Explanation**: This is essential in a real-world scenario, as large applications often require multiple components that are organized across different files.

    ```javascript
    // Greeting.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

    const Greeting = () => {
      return (
        <View>
          <Text>Custom Greeting Component</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default Greeting;
    ```

    ```javascript
    // App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import Greeting from './Greeting';

    const App = () => {
      return <Greeting />;
    };

    export default App;
    ```

    - **Expected Output**: The screen will display the message "Custom Greeting Component!"

2. **Example 2**: Replace the default `App` component with a `Greeting` component that accepts props.
    - **Explanation**: This example extends the previous one by passing a `name` prop to the `Greeting` component. This demonstrates how props are passed and how components can be customized dynamically.
    - **Explanation**: It further enhances your understanding of props and how they are used in React Native to pass data from parent to child components.

    ```javascript
    // Greeting.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

    const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
      return (
        <View>
          <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default Greeting;
    ```

    ```javascript
    // App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import Greeting from './Greeting';

    const App = () => {
      return <Greeting name="React Developer" />;
    };

### Task: Explore `View` and `Text` Components

#### Explanation 1: Understanding the `View` Component
The `View` component is the most fundamental building block for creating layouts in React Native. It acts as a container that holds other components like `Text`, `Image`, and `Button`. `View` is similar to a `div` in HTML and can be used to style, arrange, and organize elements on the screen. You can apply styles, use Flexbox for layout, and even handle touch gestures within a `View` component. It serves as a wrapper that can encapsulate different UI elements and is essential for creating a cohesive app layout.

The flexibility of the `View` component allows developers to build complex UIs by nesting other components within it. You can structure your app's layout by defining parent-child relationships with nested `View` components. Moreover, `View` components are highly customizable through `StyleSheet` and support various properties like `padding`, `margin`, `backgroundColor`, and many others.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding the `Text` Component
The `Text` component is used to display textual content in a React Native app. It is a simple, yet powerful component that allows developers to render text, style it, and manage its behavior. You can wrap text inside a `Text` component, apply different styles like font size, font weight, color, and alignment. React Native’s `Text` component also supports nesting, so you can include multiple `Text` components inside each other for advanced formatting.

In React Native, all text should be wrapped in `Text` components for proper rendering and formatting. This approach ensures that your app's text content is optimized for mobile screens, providing a consistent experience across different platforms (iOS and Android). Text styling can be customized to match the theme of your app, making it crucial to understand how to manipulate the `Text` component effectively.

### Example 1: Basic `View` and `Text` Layout

#### Explanation 1: Simple Usage of `View` and `Text`
In this example, we will create a basic `View` component that contains a single `Text` component. This layout will help you understand how to structure your app using a `View` as a container and how to display text using `Text`. The `View` serves as a wrapper for the `Text`, allowing you to apply styles to the container and control the overall layout.

#### Explanation 2: Benefits of Using `View` and `Text`
This basic example is a foundation for more complex layouts in React Native. By practicing this, you’ll understand how the `View` component handles child elements and how the `Text` component can be used to present information. This is essential in almost every React Native application, as both components are used frequently in creating user interfaces.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <Text>Hello from View and Text Components!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The app will display "Hello from View and Text Components!" with some padding around the text.

---

### Example 2: Applying Styles to `View` and `Text`

#### Explanation 1: Using `StyleSheet` for Custom Styles
In this example, we will demonstrate how to apply custom styles to both the `View` and `Text` components using the `StyleSheet` API. The `View` component will have background color, padding, and margin, while the `Text` component will have custom font size, color, and text alignment. Styling is a critical part of UI development, and `StyleSheet` provides a way to keep your styles organized and reusable.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding the Flexibility of Styling
This example helps you see how you can customize the look and feel of your app's layout. By separating styles from your component's logic, you keep your code cleaner and more modular. The ability to control how elements look using `StyleSheet` is key to building user-friendly and visually appealing mobile applications.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Styled View and Text Components</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    margin: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    color: 'blue',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The app will display "Styled View and Text Components" in blue text, centered inside a light gray `View` container with padding and margin.

### Task: Add a `Button` Component and Log a Message on Press

#### Explanation 1: The React Native `Button` Component
The `Button` component in React Native provides a simple, clickable UI element. When pressed, it triggers a specific action, such as navigating to a different screen, submitting a form, or logging a message to the console. Unlike custom buttons where you have to define styles and behavior manually, the `Button` component comes with pre-defined behavior and styling, making it an easy-to-use component for many scenarios. Buttons are interactive and provide a clear call-to-action for users, which makes them an essential part of any mobile app.

React Native’s `Button` component allows you to pass an `onPress` prop that defines what action should be taken when the button is pressed. For basic interactions like logging a message, the `onPress` function can contain simple logic such as printing a message to the console. This is a great starting point for understanding how user interactions are handled in React Native.

#### Explanation 2: Handling User Interactions with `onPress`
The `onPress` prop in React Native buttons is used to define what happens when a user presses the button. It can execute any JavaScript function or command. In this task, you'll log a message to the console when the button is clicked. This basic functionality helps you understand how events are handled in React Native and how to respond to user input. In more advanced scenarios, the `onPress` event could trigger navigation, data fetching, or state updates.

This task is fundamental because handling user interaction is one of the core aspects of building interactive mobile applications. Buttons are a direct way to receive input from users, so understanding how to manage button presses is critical for creating a functional and responsive UI.

### Example 1: Add a Button and Log a Message

#### Explanation 1: Basic Button with `onPress` Event
In this example, you'll create a simple button that logs a message to the console when pressed. This is a basic implementation of user interaction. The `Button` component takes two props: `title` to define the text shown on the button and `onPress`, which is triggered when the button is clicked.

#### Explanation 2: Logging the Button Click
This task demonstrates how easy it is to add basic interactivity to your app. When the button is pressed, the message “Button Pressed!” will be logged to the console, giving you a basic sense of how buttons work in React Native. This example is essential because logging can help you track how often certain actions are triggered and serve as a debugging tool in more complex interactions.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const handlePress = () => {
    console.log('Button Pressed!');
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ marginTop: 50 }}>
      <Button title="Press Me" onPress={handlePress} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: When the button is pressed, the message "Button Pressed!" will be logged to the console. You won’t see this in the app UI, but if you open the developer tools or emulator logs, you’ll see the message.

2. [Console Logging in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging)

---

### Example 2: Custom Button with a Different Action

#### Explanation 1: More Advanced Button Functionality
In this example, we add a button that not only logs a message to the console but also updates the state to track how many times the button has been pressed. This demonstrates a more practical use of `onPress`, where user interaction triggers state changes in the app. We will use `useState` to manage the state and update it every time the button is clicked.

#### Explanation 2: Tracking Button Press Count
This example highlights how to combine user interactions (`onPress`) with React Native state management (`useState`). By counting button presses, you can see how interactivity can affect the UI. This is a common pattern in mobile apps, where user actions modify the app’s state, triggering UI updates. The button now does more than just log a message—it also modifies and displays dynamic data.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handlePress = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(`Button pressed ${count + 1} times!`);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ marginTop: 50, alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button title="Press Me" onPress={handlePress} />
      <Text>You pressed the button {count} times</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: When the button is pressed, the text below it will update to show how many times the button has been clicked. The console will also log a message each time, such as "Button pressed 3 times!"

### Task: Test the Button Functionality on a Mobile Device

#### Explanation 1: Using Expo Go to Test on Device
After adding a button and logging messages, the next step is to test the functionality on a real device using Expo Go. Testing on a physical device is crucial because it allows you to see how your app behaves in a real-world environment. While simulators are useful, they don’t always perfectly emulate device performance, gestures, and behavior. Expo makes it easy to test React Native apps directly on your device without needing to go through the full build process.

Expo Go acts as a bridge between your development environment and your mobile device. Once your app is running, you can scan the QR code provided by Expo with your phone and see the app’s output in real-time. This is especially useful when testing UI components like buttons, where performance and responsiveness are important factors.

#### Explanation 2: Ensuring Button Responsiveness
By testing the button on a mobile device, you can verify its functionality, responsiveness, and user experience. Mobile devices vary in screen size, resolution, and processing power, so testing ensures that your app works as intended across different platforms. When testing the button, pay attention to how quickly it responds to presses, whether the state updates correctly, and if the logs appear as expected in the developer tools. Testing on real devices also helps in identifying platform-specific issues, such as differences between Android and iOS.

#### Online Resources
1. [Expo Documentation for Testing on Devices](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
2. [Testing Expo Apps on Physical Devices](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/run-on-device/)

---

### Example 1: Testing the Button in Expo Go

#### Explanation 1: Running the App on an Android/iOS Device
Once you've developed your app with a button component, open the Expo development server by running `npm start` or `expo start`. You will see a QR code appear in your terminal or browser. Open the Expo Go app on your phone, scan the QR code, and your app will launch on your mobile device.

#### Explanation 2: Observing Button Behavior on the Device
When testing, press the button to ensure that the expected console logs appear. Also, pay attention to the UI changes and how responsive the button feels on a real device. This step is essential to ensure that user interactions are being handled correctly, and that the button’s layout and size are suitable for the device's screen.

---

### Example 2: Debugging Button Press Issues

#### Explanation 1: Verifying State Changes on Button Press
If you’re using a button that updates the state, such as the one from Example 2, you can test this functionality on a physical device by pressing the button multiple times. Check the console log in the Expo developer tools to verify that the button press count is logged correctly. Watch the on-screen text to ensure that the state updates and reflects the number of times the button was pressed.

#### Explanation 2: Checking Device-Specific Issues
Sometimes, buttons may behave differently on iOS and Android due to platform-specific differences. For example, you might find that the button is more responsive on one platform or that the layout behaves differently. By testing on a device, you can catch these issues early and make any necessary adjustments before final deployment.

### Task: Study `StyleSheet` for Creating Styles in React Native

#### Explanation 1: Understanding `StyleSheet` in React Native
`StyleSheet` in React Native is a powerful API for defining and managing styles. It allows developers to separate concerns by keeping the layout and styling logic distinct from the component logic. Styles in React Native closely resemble CSS used in web development, though there are some differences, particularly in property names and supported values. For example, instead of `background-color`, React Native uses `backgroundColor`. Using `StyleSheet.create()`, you can bundle your styles in an organized and reusable way, promoting cleaner code and better performance by optimizing style calculations.

Another key advantage of using `StyleSheet` is the performance boost it offers. When you use `StyleSheet.create()`, the styles are processed ahead of time, reducing the computational cost when rendering components. This is crucial for mobile applications, where performance and smooth user experiences are a top priority. Moreover, `StyleSheet` allows you to use Flexbox for layout, ensuring responsive designs that work well across various screen sizes.

#### Explanation 2: Structuring and Organizing Styles
A good practice when using `StyleSheet` is to define styles separately and apply them to your components via the `style` prop. This keeps your code more modular and readable, as all styling logic is in one place. You can also define conditional styles by using JavaScript logic to apply styles dynamically based on certain conditions (e.g., dark mode or user interaction).

The `StyleSheet` can handle complex layouts, animations, and media queries, offering flexibility similar to what you might expect from CSS, but tailored for mobile development. By mastering `StyleSheet`, you gain control over the presentation layer of your React Native applications, making it easy to create visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly mobile interfaces.

### Example 1: Create a Simple Custom Style

#### Explanation 1: Basic Usage of `StyleSheet`
In this example, we will create a simple `StyleSheet` that defines the layout and look of a `View` and `Text` component. The `StyleSheet.create()` function is used to define the style object, which will be applied to the components via the `style` prop. This method keeps the styling logic centralized and reusable across different components.

#### Explanation 2: Applying the Custom Styles
By practicing this, you will understand how to define and apply styles to different components. This includes customizing properties like `fontSize`, `color`, `padding`, and `backgroundColor`. Applying custom styles allows you to build apps with specific branding or user interface themes that cater to your target audience's design preferences.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Welcome to My App</Text>
      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>This is a custom styled component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f8f8f8',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
  subtitle: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#666',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The app displays a centered title with the text "Welcome to My App" in bold, large font, and a smaller subtitle that says "This is a custom styled component." The background color of the `View` is light gray, and the text colors are dark.

### Example 2: Flexbox Layout with Custom Styles

#### Explanation 1: Using Flexbox in `StyleSheet`
In this example, we will use the Flexbox system in React Native to create a responsive layout. The `StyleSheet` will include properties like `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems` to arrange the `View` components. Flexbox is the primary layout mechanism in React Native, and learning it will give you great control over how elements are positioned and displayed across different screen sizes.

#### Explanation 2: Benefits of Flexbox with `StyleSheet`
Flexbox allows you to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes without hardcoding pixel values. By defining the styles using Flexbox properties, you ensure that the app looks consistent on both iOS and Android devices. This example will demonstrate how you can use `flexDirection` to arrange items in a row or column and how `justifyContent` and `alignItems` affect their alignment.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Box 1</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Box 2</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.box}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Box 3</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  box: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: '#3498db',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The app will display three blue boxes evenly spaced in a horizontal row. Each box contains centered white text saying "Box 1", "Box 2", and "Box 3". The background color of the screen is light gray.

### Task: Create a Custom Style and Apply it to Components

#### Explanation 1: Customizing Styles for a Unique UI
After studying the `StyleSheet`, the next step is to create your custom styles and apply them to different components in your app. By defining styles for components like `View`, `Text`, `Button`, or any other UI elements, you control the look and feel of your app. You can create themes, apply consistent styles across screens, and enhance the overall user experience. Customizing styles is essential to making your app stand out and aligning it with your design guidelines or branding.

Custom styles often include typography (font sizes, weights, colors), layout (margins, paddings, flex properties), and interaction feedback (hover, pressed, or active states). Using `StyleSheet` allows you to organize these styles into reusable blocks, making your codebase more maintainable. It’s important to test these styles on both iOS and Android devices, as there might be subtle differences in how styles are rendered.

#### Explanation 2: Testing and Iterating on Custom Styles
Once you apply the custom styles, it’s important to test how they appear on the actual device using Expo Go. Sometimes the styles might need adjustment based on the screen size, resolution, or platform (iOS vs. Android). Testing and iterating your custom styles will ensure that your UI is responsive, accessible, and visually appealing.

By practicing with different styling configurations and layouts, you’ll develop a better understanding of how to create a cohesive design system that provides a consistent look and feel throughout your application.

### Task: Modify `View` Component to Experiment with Different Layouts

#### Explanation 1: Understanding the `View` Component
The `View` component in React Native is a fundamental building block for UI layouts. It acts as a container for other components like `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, etc., and is equivalent to a `<div>` in web development. By default, `View` components are rendered as block elements and can be styled using the `style` prop, where you can define properties such as dimensions, background color, margins, padding, and more. One of the key features of the `View` component is its flexibility to handle both simple and complex layouts when combined with the Flexbox layout system.

In React Native, experimenting with the `View` component allows you to test different design structures for your app. For example, by changing its layout properties, you can create different grid systems, column-based designs, or even more complex nested layouts. Practicing with `View` gives you the foundation to organize your app’s content and create user-friendly designs that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.

#### Explanation 2: Experimenting with Layout Variations
One of the key aspects of working with `View` is exploring how different layout properties (like `flex`, `padding`, and `margin`) affect the appearance of your components. You can experiment by nesting multiple `View` components inside one another and applying various styles, such as `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`, to create unique layouts. This experimentation helps you understand how different layout mechanisms impact user interfaces and ensures your app can handle dynamic content and user interactions gracefully.

By modifying the `View` component in various ways, you gain better control over how elements are presented. For example, you can create layouts with fixed headers and footers, sidebars, or responsive designs that adjust based on the available screen size. This practice is crucial when building apps for multiple devices with different screen resolutions.

### Example 1: Nested `View` Components with Different Layouts

#### Explanation 1: Creating Nested Layouts with `View`
In this example, we will create a layout where multiple `View` components are nested within each other. By applying different styles like `padding`, `margin`, and background colors, we can visualize how these components are organized. Nested layouts are commonly used in UI design to group related content or define hierarchical structures for headers, content areas, and footers.

#### Explanation 2: Testing the Layout
Practicing with nested `View` components allows you to understand how parent-child relationships between components affect layout positioning. This is particularly useful for creating complex UIs, such as card-based designs or multi-column layouts. You’ll see how inner components inherit or override the styles of their parent components and how padding and margin influence spacing.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.outerContainer}>
      <View style={styles.innerContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Inside Nested View</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  outerContainer: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  innerContainer: {
    backgroundColor: '#4CAF50',
    padding: 30,
    borderRadius: 10,
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The app displays a centered green box inside a light gray background. The green box contains white text that says, "Inside Nested View," and it’s padded and styled with rounded corners.

### Example 2: Creating a Multi-Column Layout with `View`

#### Explanation 1: Experimenting with Multiple `View` Components
In this example, you will create a multi-column layout using the `View` component combined with Flexbox. The layout will consist of two `View` components aligned side by side. Using Flexbox properties such as `flexDirection: 'row'` and `justifyContent`, you can position the child components horizontally and space them evenly.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding the Flexbox Impact on Layout
This example demonstrates how Flexbox can be used with `View` to create complex layouts that are responsive and fluid. Practicing with Flexbox helps you understand how to handle various layout needs, including content that needs to be dynamically arranged across multiple devices. It also reinforces how to use alignment and spacing techniques to control the arrangement of components.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.column}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Column 1</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.column}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Column 2</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    padding: 20,
  },
  column: {
    backgroundColor: '#FFC107',
    padding: 30,
    width: '45%',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: Two yellow columns with white text aligned side by side, each taking up 45% of the screen width. The content is spaced evenly using Flexbox properties.

### Task: Learn About Flexbox Layout

#### Explanation 1: Introduction to Flexbox in React Native
Flexbox is the primary layout mechanism used in React Native. It allows you to design complex layouts that can adjust dynamically based on screen size and orientation. The Flexbox model arranges components inside a container in one of two directions—`row` (horizontal) or `column` (vertical). This is controlled using the `flexDirection` property. Other key Flexbox properties include `justifyContent`, which controls how children are aligned along the main axis, and `alignItems`, which manages alignment along the cross-axis.

Flexbox is extremely powerful because it lets you create responsive designs without relying on fixed dimensions. By mastering Flexbox, you can design apps that work seamlessly across devices, from phones to tablets. Flexbox's adaptive nature makes it an ideal choice for modern mobile app development, ensuring that your UI remains flexible and easy to manage.

#### Explanation 2: Practical Application of Flexbox
Using Flexbox, you can control spacing, alignment, and positioning of elements in a predictable way. For example, if you want to distribute components evenly along the screen or center them both vertically and horizontally, Flexbox offers clear, concise ways to achieve this. Flexbox's properties like `flexGrow`, `flexShrink`, and `flexBasis` further allow you to define how components should stretch or contract to fit the available space.

Understanding Flexbox is essential when designing mobile applications, especially if you’re targeting different screen sizes and want a consistent layout. It helps avoid layout issues that can arise from using absolute positioning and gives you a more fluid approach to arranging UI elements.

### Example 1: Vertical Centering with Flexbox

#### Explanation 1: Flexbox Vertical and Horizontal Centering
In this example, we use Flexbox to center a `Text` component both vertically and horizontally. Flexbox properties like `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'` ensure that the child component is centered inside the parent `View`.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding Flexbox's Alignment Properties
Practicing with this layout helps you grasp how Flexbox controls the distribution and alignment of items along both axes. This is a common layout pattern in mobile apps, such as splash screens or loader animations.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Centered Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#4CAF50',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: A screen with a green background and white text "Centered Text" displayed in the middle of the screen.

### Example 2: Space Between Layout with Flexbox

#### Explanation 1: Distributing Components Evenly
In this example, we will use Flexbox to distribute three `View` components evenly across the screen. This is achieved using the `justifyContent: 'space-between'` property, which ensures that there’s equal space between the components, with the first and last items aligned to the edges of the container.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding the Flexbox Space Distribution
This example demonstrates how to create layouts where components need to be spaced consistently without manually setting margins. Flexbox’s space distribution properties are ideal for ensuring that elements are distributed evenly regardless of screen size or content amount.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.box}><Text style={styles.text}>Box 1</Text></View>
      <View style={styles.box}><Text style={styles.text}>Box 2</Text></View>
      <View style={styles.box}><Text style={styles.text}>Box 3</Text></View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    padding: 20,
  },
  box: {
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: '#2196F3',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: Three blue boxes with white text arranged vertically, with equal space between them. The first box is aligned at the top, and the last box is aligned at the bottom of the screen.

2. [React Native Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)

### Task: Implement a Flexbox Layout using `justifyContent` and `alignItems`

#### Explanation 1: Understanding `justifyContent` in Flexbox
The `justifyContent` property in React Native's Flexbox layout is used to define how components are aligned along the main axis (horizontal in a `row`, vertical in a `column`). This property allows you to distribute space between children within the parent container. Common values for `justifyContent` include `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, `space-between`, and `space-around`. For example, `justifyContent: 'center'` will center all the child components along the main axis, whereas `justifyContent: 'space-between'` will distribute them evenly with space between each child.

This property is especially useful when you want to create layouts that dynamically adjust based on the screen size. For instance, you can align buttons in a toolbar at the start or end of the screen or create a vertical list of components that are evenly spaced.

#### Explanation 2: Understanding `alignItems` in Flexbox
The `alignItems` property controls how children are aligned along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis). In a `row`, this will affect the vertical alignment of components, and in a `column`, it will affect the horizontal alignment. Common values for `alignItems` include `flex-start`, `center`, and `flex-end`. For example, using `alignItems: 'center'` will center all child components along the cross-axis.

Using `alignItems` together with `justifyContent` gives you full control over the placement of components within a layout. You can center components both horizontally and vertically or distribute them across the screen in complex ways that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

### Example 1: Centering Elements Using `justifyContent` and `alignItems`

#### Explanation 1: Creating a Centered Layout
In this example, we use `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'` to center all child components both vertically and horizontally within the parent container. This is a common pattern used for loading screens, welcome screens, or when you need to place content in the center of the screen.

#### Explanation 2: Testing Flexbox Centering
This example will help you practice how to align content dynamically using Flexbox. It demonstrates the simplicity of controlling complex layouts with just a few properties. As you test different screen sizes, you will see how the layout adjusts without the need for fixed dimensions.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Centered Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    color: '#333',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: A screen with a gray background and the text "Centered Text" displayed at the exact center of the screen.

### Example 2: Distributing Components Using `space-between`

#### Explanation 1: Even Distribution with `space-between`
In this example, we will use `justifyContent: 'space-between'` to distribute three `Text` components evenly along the vertical axis. Each component will be positioned with equal space between them, ensuring a visually balanced layout.

#### Explanation 2: Practicing Space Distribution in Layouts
This example is ideal for creating layouts where you need to space elements evenly, such as buttons in a footer or items in a navigation menu. It shows how Flexbox simplifies the layout process by automating the spacing between elements, eliminating the need for manual margins.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Item 1</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Item 2</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Item 3</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    color: '#333',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: Three `Text` components ("Item 1", "Item 2", and "Item 3") displayed vertically with equal space between them, filling the entire height of the screen.

### Task: Add Multiple `Text` Components with Different Styles

#### Explanation 1: The `Text` Component in React Native
The `Text` component is essential for displaying text in React Native applications. It supports styling, similar to CSS for web development, which allows you to apply different font sizes, colors, alignments, and more. The `Text` component also supports nesting, meaning you can style individual parts of the text differently within the same component. This is useful for highlighting certain words, changing colors, or applying different fonts.

You can customize the appearance of the `Text` component through the `style` prop, where you can define properties such as `fontSize`, `color`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, and more. Multiple `Text` components can be combined to create headers, paragraphs, and other textual elements within your app.

#### Explanation 2: Styling Multiple `Text` Components
Adding multiple `Text` components with different styles allows you to create distinct sections of text in your UI. For example, you can use one `Text` component for a header with larger, bold text, and another for a subheading or paragraph with smaller, lighter text. Each `Text` component can have its own unique style, which makes it easy to design structured text content, such as article layouts or forms with labels.

By practicing with multiple `Text` components, you gain an understanding of how to apply styles effectively and how to organize textual content in your app's UI. This is especially important for building readable and accessible interfaces.

#### Explanation 2: Experimenting with Text Styles
This example demonstrates how to style multiple `Text` components with different properties, such as `fontSize`, `color`, and `fontWeight`. Testing this will help you visualize how different font styles affect the overall design and readability of your app.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>Header Text</Text>
      <Text style={styles.subHeader}>Subheader Text</Text>
      <Text style={styles.body}>This is body text with a different style.</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  header: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
  subHeader: {
    fontSize: 18,
    color: '#666',
  },
  body: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#999',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- **Expected Output**: The screen displays three `Text` components: a large bold "Header Text", a medium "Subheader Text", and a smaller gray "body text".

### Example 2: Nested `Text` Components with Different Styles

#### Explanation 1: Styling Nested Text
In this example, we will nest two `Text` components within a parent `Text` component. Each child `Text` component will have its own style, allowing for mixed styling within the same block of text. This is useful for creating rich text layouts, such as articles or descriptions with bold or highlighted sections.

#### Explanation 2: Testing Nested Text Styles
This example is perfect for practicing how to apply multiple styles within a single `Text` component. By nesting `Text` components, you can create complex text
